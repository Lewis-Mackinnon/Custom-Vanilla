 dp_light_battery_desc:0 "A small gun in a special mount, allowing it to engage aeroplanes as well as surface targets."
 ship_heavy_battery_1_desc:0 "A large-calibre cannon dating from before the Great War."
 ship_heavy_battery_2_desc:1 "A set of large-calibre cannons in a heavily armoured mount. A redesign of the turret allows for higher gun elevation, thus increasing the range."
 ship_heavy_battery_3_desc:0 "A heavily armoured mount for heavy guns, incorporating a number of new technologies to increase accuracy and firing speed."
 ship_heavy_battery_4_desc:0 "The ultimate evolution of heavy firepower, this heavily armoured mount allows for a high degree of accuracy over long distances."
 ship_super_heavy_battery_1_desc:0 "The biggest gun ever mounted on a ship, these massive cannons were designed to penetrate any feasible armour at any distance."
 ship_light_medium_battery_3_desc:0 "Incorporating a number of new technologies, this lightly armoured mount further increases the gap between the main batteries of destroyers and light cruisers."
 ship_medium_battery_2_desc:0 "An evolution of an earlier design, this gun was made to keep pace with the increases in armour and the longer ranges at which naval battles are fought."
 ship_medium_battery_3_desc:0 "While not the biggest gun one can feasibly mount on a cruiser, this cannon strikes the best balance between weight of armament and fire power and can reliably defeat cruiser armour."
 ship_medium_battery_4_desc:0 "With calibre restricted by existing ammunition supplies and with an eye to retrofit older ships, this new gun features an advanced auto-loading system to drastically improve the rate of fire."
 ship_secondaries_1_desc:0 "Housed in a casemate on the ship's side, this light cannon gives larger ships some measure of defence against smaller ships."
 dp_ship_secondaries_desc:0 "By combining the duties of the heavy anti-air gun and the secondary battery, this mount drastically boosts the anti-air capabilities of a ship while also providing some measure of defence against smaller surface targets."
 ship_anti_air_1_desc:0 "A set of heavy machine guns provides a small amount of close-in defence against aeroplanes."
 ship_anti_air_3_desc:0 "Previous calibres of guns have proven too light to reliably kill an attacking aeroplane before they can release their ordinance. A larger shell requires a bigger gun, but has a significantly higher chance of destroying the target when they actually hit."
 ship_anti_air_4_desc:0 "The latest model of anti-air guns features a powered mount to be able to track fast-flying targets and an advanced director system to co-ordinate the fire of several gun positions against a single target."
 ship_depth_charge_3_desc:0 "A projector for a smaller depth charge with a contact fuse, allowing the ship to engage a target without breaking sonar contact."
 ship_airplane_launcher_1_desc:0 "A simple aeroplane launcher propels a small scout plane into the air."
 ship_deck_space_desc:0 "A large open area inside the ship that allows the servicing and arming of wheeled aeroplanes. Adding further hangar space to a ship dramatically drives up cost."
 ship_radar_1_desc:0 "A simple radar set that operates in the 50cm wavelength range allows the detection of surface ships even in bad weather at a range of more than 10 kilometres."
 ship_radar_2_desc:0 "An improved radar set working in the 30cm wavelength range can accurately measure the range and bearing of even a small ship at ranges of over 25 kilometres."
 ship_radar_4_desc:0 "Working in the centimetre wavelength range, this radar set is fully integrated into the ships gunnery control and allows highly accurate gunfire control in all weather conditions."
 heavy_ship_engine_1_desc:0 "Intended to free up weight for guns and armour, this engine was never designed to give particularly high speed."
 heavy_ship_engine_3_desc:0 "As guns and armour grow in weight, this engine was designed to allow for higher speeds to chase down fleeing enemies or keep the range open against superior enemies."
 carrier_ship_engine_4_desc:0 "This powerplant was designed to equip a modern 'fast carrier' intended to function as the centrepiece of a carrier group."
 ship_armor_bb_1_short:0 "Battleship Armour I"
 ship_armor_bb_1_desc:0 "Designed to protect a ship against guns of its own calibre, this armour scheme ensures that every part of the ship is well-protected according to its usefulness."
 ship_armor_bc_1_short:0 "Battlecruiser Armour I"
 ship_armor_bc_1_desc:0 "Designed to protect the ship against smaller guns, this armour scheme weighs far less to allow for higher speed."
 ship_armor_bb_2_short:0 "Battleship Armour II"
 ship_armor_bb_2_desc:0 "Featuring an inclined belt, this armour scheme is designed to protect a ship of the line against guns of its own calibre."
 ship_armor_bc_2_short:0 "Battlecruiser Armour II"
 ship_armor_bc_2_desc:0 "A compromise between speed and protection, this armour scheme is designed to defend a ship against the guns of cruisers and destroyers."
 ship_armor_bb_3_short:0 "Battleship Armour III"
 ship_armor_bb_3_desc:0 "A radical departure from previous armour schemes, this design creates a heavily-armoured citadel at the centre of the ship but sacrifices protection for other parts of the ship. It is intended to defend a ship against guns of its own calibre."
 ship_armor_bc_3_short:0 "Battlecruiser Armour III"
 ship_armor_bc_3_desc:0 "Designed with an eye towards weight limitations, this armour scheme attempts to maximise protection for the vital parts of a ship by leaving other areas exposed. This scheme is not supposed to stand up to battleship-grade weaponry for long."
 ship_armor_shbb_short:0 "Super-Heavy Armour"
 ship_armor_shbb_desc:0 "The last word in armour design, this armour scheme is intended to defeat all known main battery projectiles, allowing a ship so equipped to engage and sink any other battleship in the world today."
 ship_armor_cruiser_1_short:0 "Cruiser Armour I"
 ship_armor_cruiser_1_desc:0 "An armour scheme intended to give a cruiser a slight edge when fighting against destroyers and other lightly-armed ships."
 ship_armor_cruiser_2_short:0 "Cruiser Armour II"
 ship_armor_cruiser_3_short:0 "Cruiser Armour III"
 ship_armor_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Copying methods used for armouring battleships, this armour scheme is designed to keep pace with developments in armaments around the world."
 ship_armor_cruiser_4_short:0 "Cruiser Armour IV"
 ship_armor_cruiser_4_desc:0 "This armour scheme attempts to maximise protection over the areas absolutely needed to keep a ship afloat and in the fight, at the cost of all other areas."
 ship_armor_carrier_deck_short:0 "Flight Deck Armour"
 ship_armor_carrier_deck_desc:0 "Heavy armour plates protect the hangar spaces against hits by enemy bombers at the cost of less working space."
