 ss_recruitment_event.8.desc:0 "In this titanic struggle of national survival, we must use every asset and every advantage. The SS believes that there are many in Lithuania who would gladly pick up arms and fight by our side against the threat of global bolshevism.\n\nWhile the Wehrmacht agrees in principle that some recruitment of suitable volunteers could be useful, the Generals in the OKW very strongly believe that any foreign volunteers should be under military - not SS - command.\n\nReports from the local administrators point towards a wide-spread boycott to any recruitment activity being organised by local leaders."

 ss_recruitment_event.15.desc:0 "Fortune - or providence - seems to favour [GER.GetLeader], as the bomb blast in his headquarters only slightly injured him. Several others near him were not as lucky.\n\nAfter receiving medical treatment for a few minor burns and superficial cuts, [GER.GetLeader] immediately met with representatives of the party, the SS and the Gestapo to discuss further steps."
 ss_recruitment_event.20.b:0 "A smaller force ensures that only the best of our people wear this mantle of honour."
 ss_recruitment_event.21.desc:0 "Reports have arrived that Himmler has called the upper leadership of the SS to Wewelsburg castle for urgent consultations. The exact contents of these consultations are unknown, but it stands to reason that they are connected to the continued frustrations of Himmler with the leadership of the party. [GER.GetLeader] still seems to follow the advice of the Wehrmacht when it comes to military matters, blocking Himmler's attempts at creating and expanding an independent armed force as a counterweight.\n\nRumour has it that Himmler has instead turned his attention towards creating what he calls "a new Order of Teutonic Knights for a new Germany". These "Knights" swear fanatical loyalty and unquestioning obedience to Himmler personally and are each gifted a sword made to Himmler's design from steel blessed in old Germanic rituals - presumably to slay the enemies of the New Germany."
 ss_recruitment_event.22.desc:0 "The government has received a number of complaints from several factory managers. They received orders for materials from an 'SS Office of Construction and Procurement'. Upon delivery, they were sent to an 'SS Office of Financial Affairs', which was supposed to pay them, but instead forwarded them further to an 'SS Office for Economic Co-operation', where they were told that the original office was supposed to pay them directly.\n\nPerhaps even more disturbing are the materials ordered - precision machinery, large amounts of chemicals used to make fertilizer as well as quantities of steel and sheet metal.\n\nHimmler has refused to discuss these events with government officials, but was overheard talking to a high-ranking SS liaison officer in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, saying that 'if [GER.GetLeader] won't give me guns, I will just have to build my own. I don't care where or how I get what I need for that.'"
 ss_recruitment_event.26.desc:0 "As the smoke in the Führer Headquarters cleared, Heinrich Himmler emerged from the chaotic firefight as the sole survivor. According to his testimony, the Führer, clearly gripped by madness, had declared him a complete failure of a man and a soldier, a traitor and a spy to be shot at dawn. Realising that he must choose between his personal honour and the survival of the nation, Himmler decided to act immediately and shot him. In the aftermath, members of the Führer's guard detail attempted to kill Himmler as an assassin. Only the timely arrival of Himmler's own bodyguards saved the Reichsführer SS.\n\n Across Germany, the news of the death of the Führer has evidently served as a signal to put long-prepared plans into action. Both SS and regular Army units raced to secure bridges, telephone exchanges and crossroads, with Luftwaffe paratroopers rapidly mobilising to seize airfields all across the Reich.\n\nGermany stands at the edge of a civil war, and all three factions will rely on the civilian government to actually run the country."
