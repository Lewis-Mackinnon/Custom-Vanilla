 germany.5.d:1 "Germany proposes that we sign a pact to address the Comintern's goal of spreading Communism worldwide, through the use of subversion and violence. By signing this pact, we agree to share intelligence on the Communist threat and act in close co-operation against this menace."
 germany.15.t:0 "Germany Honours the Pact"
 germany.20.d:0 "Recognising that a new order has been established in Europe, we have been asked by Hungary and Romania to arbitrate in a territorial dispute between the two countries. Transylvania was taken from Hungary and incorporated into Romania in one of the many ill-conceived changes forced upon the world at Versailles. Should Northern Transylvania be returned to Hungarian control?"
 germany.24.b:0 "No, our advisers will stay."
 germany.24.c:0 "No, our advisers will stay, just as we have promised the Chinese."
 germany.25.t:0 "Military Advisers Recalled"
 germany.25.d:0 "Deteriorating relations with China has made it politically unfeasible to maintain a military mission in their country. Alexander von Falkenhausen and the rest of our advisers have been recalled."
 germany.26.t:0 "China Detains Military Advisers"
 germany.26.d:0 "Germany and China are in a state of war, and the Chinese have consequently detained the German military advisers that were reforming their army. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his officers managed to elude capture, and are now on their way back to Europe."
 germany.48.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British have seen reason and accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, but the stubborn French are refusing to back down.\n\nThey have abandoned their co-operation with Britain and forged closer ties with the Czechs instead. It looks like we will have to deal with them both at the same time, but at least now the British hopefully won't intervene..."
 germany.50.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nRecognising the hopelessness of their situation, the Czechs have surrendered the Sudeten territories to us. Their oppressed German inhabitants will at long last be brought into the Vaterland!"
 germany.53.d:0 "Not content with stealing the Sudetenland, the Germans have now decided to seize the rest of our nation. Abandoned by our so-called allies, and with our best defences lost in the Munich Diktat, the situation appears hopeless..."
 germany.54.d:0 "The Czechs have somehow mustered the courage to fight our occupation of their country. Their best defences were in the Sudetenland, which is now under our control, so this should be a swift campaign."
 germany.60.t:0 "The Remilitarisation of the Rhineland"
 germany.60.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarising the region! Unless we issue an ultimatum demanding their withdrawal, the treaty will not be enforced."
 germany.61.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarising the region!\n\nThe French are mobilising their forces, and seem intent on issuing an ultimatum. If Germany refuses, they are prepared to advance into Germany to deal with this threat. Popular opinion in Britain is against a war, but if we refuse to stand by the French our alliance with them will be dissolved."
 germany.62.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarising the region!\n\nThe French seem content to limit their response to this breach to diplomatic objections, and public opinion in Britain is firmly against a war."
 germany.63.d:0 "The British are refusing to support us against Germany, claiming that the Germans are 'simply walking in their own backyard.' If we go to war with them, it looks like we will be on our own.\n\nPublic opinion in France is against a war, but Germany will only grow stronger and the remilitarisation of the Rhineland constitutes a direct threat against our borders. Issuing an ultimatum would be less threatening without Britain on our side. Should we proceed against them alone?"
 germany.64.d:0 "Though popular support for a war is lacking in Britain, the British government has recognised the threat posed by the Germans and they have offered us their full support. We will issue a final ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from the demilitarised zone. If they refuse, it is time for our forces to drive deep into Germany and put an end to their tyrannical regime!"
 germany.65.t:0 "France and Britain Mobilise!"
 germany.65.d:0 "The British and French have refused to accept the remilitarisation of the Rhineland, calling it an 'unforgivable breach' of the Versailles Treaty. They are mobilising their forces against us and have issued an ultimatum that our forces back down at once and the Rhineland remains demilitarised, or our nations are at war."
 germany.66.t:0 "France Mobilises!"
 germany.66.d:0 "The British have seen reason and accepted the remilitarisation of the Rhineland, but the mad French are refusing to back down! Claiming that this incident constitutes a direct threat against the security of their nation, they are mobilising their forces and may sweep in across the border at any moment! We are at war!"
 germany.67.d:0 "The French wisely chose to back down when they realised that their mad enterprise wouldn't enjoy British support. Their forces have been demobilised and war has been averted for now. By golly, that was a close one!"
 germany.76.d:0 "Our negotiations with the [From.GetName] have been successful. An agreement has been reached where our nations will aid each other in the development of new armoured units, with a possible extension to other research areas in the future."
 germany.77.d:0 "The [From.GetName] has rejected our suggestion for a treaty aimed at advancing armoured unit research in both countries, presumably fearing our superior weapons would be turned against them."
 germany.81.d:0 "Poland has agreed to the exchange wherein Danzig will be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], while Slovakia will now be under Polish control. Through this agreement, we have reclaimed Danzig while maintaining cordial, or at least not openly hostile, relations with our eastern neighbour."
 germany.84.d:0 "Just as we suspected when we signed the Anti-Soviet Pact, we now find ourselves in a state of war with the Soviet Union. It is time for our co-signatories to honour their promise and join us."
 germany.85.b_tt:0 "§YThis will be viewed as a betrayal by all countries who honour the pact (§!§R-50§!§Y opinion)§!"
 germany.86.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has long publicised their goal of reclaiming the territories they lost in the Great War. In particular they look to the territory of Danzig, which separates Ostpreussen from the rest of their nation. \n\nNow, they have demanded that Danzig be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], and in exchange offer nothing but a promise to waive their claims on Poznan. With the threat of war looming, accepting the offer will delay a possible conflict, but at the cost of freely granting the Germans more strength for whatever lies ahead."
 china.2.t:0 "Germany Withdraws Advisers"
 china.2.d:0 "Germany has caved in to Japanese diplomatic pressure, and decided to withdraw their military advisers from our country! Von Falkenhausen promised at a farewell dinner that he would not reveal any of our battle plans to the Japanese, but the end of German support is sure to hurt our military."
 china.3.d:0 "Our deteriorating relationship with Germany has resulted in them recalling all of their military advisers from our country."
 china.4.t:0 "Military Advisers Detained"
 china.4.d:0 "As we are now in a state of war with Germany, all of their military advisers that were present in our country have been detained. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his cronies managed to elude our grasp, and have returned to Europe!"
 china.9.d:0 "Our commitment to routing the Red Army has been successful, at least for now. Despite gaining information about the attack, the communists decided to confront our forces and lost. They have now been forced to withdraw further and many of the locals have grown sceptical of their ability to deliver on their promises of overthrowing our government."
 china.12.d:0 "Challenging the Kuomintang offensive has worked in our favour. The locally assembled troops sent to confront the Red Army were not prepared for our knowledge of the impending attack and were defeated, all serving as a warning to nearby warlords that attacking us can be costly. \n\nThe nationalists have only proven that they underestimate us as a foe, and that the People's Republic is once again on the rise."
 china.14.d:0 "Despite our efforts to push show that the communists will not be allowed to expand their influence outside of where they have currently taken refuge, we could not afford to commit enough resources to win the conflict along the [From.GetName] border.\n\nThe sporadic conflicts with communist militias slowly turned out more and more in their favour, which in the end made the campaign a failure in demonstrating that we have the situation under control. If their popular support keeps increasing, the communists could turn out to be a genuine threat."
 china.16.d:0 "Our efforts to wage an indirect war against the increased Kuomintang presence has proven disastrous. The nationalists were simply more dedicated to pushing us back than we thought, perhaps expecting the impact this failure would have on our reputation. Although our army is once again safe to recover, for now, the losses have not gone unnoticed by the locals, and rumours of the failure of the revolution are already spreading to nearby villages."
 china.17.d:0 "Our efforts to draw the line against the threat of communism have been successful. The CPCs guerrilla campaigns in response to our increased troop presence in regions surrounding their power base failed to anticipate our dedication to stopping them. This show of strength, although not entirely without costs, has convinced many of the locals who previously gave their tacit support to [From.GetLeader] and his party have now begun to realise that China can never be united under such an ideology."
 china.201.d:0 "Having broken free from nationalist control, Chinese revolutionaries who sympathise with our cause have made the decision to join their state with ours under the leadership of [Root.GetLeader]. Now and henceforth, there shall be one united People's Republic of China."
 china.203.d:0 "Having broken free from nationalist control, Chinese revolutionaries who sympathise with our cause have made the decision to join their state with ours under the leadership of [Root.GetLeader]. Now and henceforth, there shall be one united [Root.GetName]."
 CHI_no_united_front:0 "There will be no co-operation against external threats."
 spain.10.d:1 "After the peaceful election of General Francisco Franco as president of Spain, there was hope that recent years violent uprisings and political turmoil would be put to an end. Rumours that Franco would attempt to create a one-party dictatorship with himself as chief of state has been fuelled by the sudden disappearances of several opposition leaders.\nAfter a swift trial, Carabineros officer José Galánfor was convicted of treason and his public execution followed shortly after. Though it was meant as a move to stamp out any will to resist the rise of Nationalist Spain it had the opposite effect. Leftist volunteers and even a group of generals have flocked to the banners of the newly formed People's Army, ready to support the fight against the oppressive Nationalists. Though most are poorly trained, they have managed to capture several key cities in the chaos that ensued the uprising.\n\nThe battle-lines have been drawn - which faction should we support?"
 spain.2.d:0 "The coup has not been a complete success, but Carlists, Falangists and the Confederation of the Autonomous Right have managed to mobilise a large part of the army to overthrow the Republic, which has too long allowed our proud Christian nation to fall apart into anarchy. The outcome is still uncertain, with the world watching with concern which side will emerge victorious.\n\nWe did not execute this coup by standing idly by, however, and neither should the world if it wants to crush the red threat. Other nations in the same process of restoring their national glory should be willing to come to our aid."
 spain.3.d:0 "Reactionary and fascist forces in the military have sought to crush the Republic in one swift blow, but did not expect the resistance they met in major cities nor the rapid mobilisation of workers' militias. Rather than a coup, they have started a war, war on progress and the future the Spanish people wanted.\n\nDemocratic and socialist nations alike voice support for the Republic, but few dare commit to direct involvement. We could ask them to support our endeavour, or the oppressors will come for their liberty and solidarity next."
 spain.8.d:0 "The war is won. Madrid is ours again and we have opportunity to make the age old city the centre of Spain once again. It has seen much battle and will require rebuilding. What better way to do this than making it our capital?"
 italy.9.d:0 "During the civil war, Italy offered volunteers to fight for the nationalist cause. Although ideological motivations were paramount, Italy also had a strategic stake in the outcome. The defence of the Balearic Islands, especially Majorca, was of special interest to Italy due to their position in the Mediterranean Sea, especially in relation to west European colonies.\n\nNow, [From.GetLeader] has suggested the islands to be transferred to Italian control permanently. Considering their contribution to our victory, there may be merits to the suggestions."
 italy.10.d:0 "Thankful of our support and defence of the fascist cause during the Spanish Civil War, [From.GetLeader] has agreed to make our temporary military installations on Majorca, Minorca and Ibiza permanent. Although these islands with their important strategic position are a welcome addition to our empire, it seems the Spaniards now consider the debt repaid."
 italy.12.d:0 "Our friends in Yugoslavia have come under pressure from our northern neighbour. The corrupt and decadent western powers have shown why they are fading away by failing to stand up for the rights of Yugoslavia. This could be exactly the opening for a younger, more dynamic power who has the right leadership to stride purposely upon the world stage! The Commando Supremo reports they are almost ready to unleash our invincible legions."
 italy.13.d_dalmatia:0 "After the betrayal of our former allies in the west at the Paris peace conference, where we were promised northern Dalmatia, we chose to align ourselves with Berlin. Germany has wisely judged that Italian friendship is too valuable to ignore and our claims in Yugoslavia are to be recognised. The Adriatic will be an Italian lake and justice will be done."
 france.3.d:0 "We have begun work on improving the fortifications of the Alpine Line. When these new defences are finished, the Italians would have to be mad to cross the border!"
 france.11.d:0 "The situation in France is dire. Many in their government wish to seek an armistice with Germany, but some have responded favourably to a suggestion by members of the British War Cabinet to merge our two nations into one. This Franco-British Union will continue the fight against the Germans until victory is achieved. How should we respond?"
 france.19.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to offer support to the Little Entente, our most recent attempt to reach out to one of the nations has been met with scepticism. [From.GetLeader] has refused to join the alliance, perhaps doubting our motives, or perhaps being concerned that aligning too closely with us would make them a target."
 france.21.d:0 "Following the sacking of two workers at a large factory, struggles between workers and factory owners have erupted across the country. Workers backed by [Root.GetCommunistParty] have organised and are demanding better conditions, such as higher wages and shorter work weeks. This will greatly reduce the output of our factories and is viewed as a victory for [Root.GetCommunistParty]. We are invited to Matignon for negotiations. Do we give in to their demands or stand firm and risk a countrywide strike?"
 france.22.d:0 "With the recently signed Matignon agreements our industry have no way of competing with the German. We are falling behind in production capacity with each passing day. Some factory owners have already started renegotiating some of the rights that were granted at the Matignon Agreements, with little to no resistance from the workers. We have an opportunity to officially revoke the newly gained worker rights countrywide, but risk them rallying behind [Root.GetCommunistParty] once again, in hopes that they will back another strike. Letting the workers keep their rights and focussing on optimising the current workflow may help reunite the French people and let us grow together."
 france.23.d:0 "Most workers have now realised that their unreasonable demands will not be met. Their children go hungry and even though [Root.GetCommunistParty] are urging them to continue the strike, they do not possess the resources to continue. With each passing day workers are caving and return to the factories. Our industry will be back to full capacity and it is unlikely we will have strikes anytime soon."
 france.30.d:0 "'While we have enjoyed good relations in the past, we cannot risk an escalation of the conflicts across the channel. Germany has earned our trust in the honouring of our Naval Pact, and while we will defend ourselves should the fires spread we will not risk fanning the flames. Peace must always be the goal of any democratic nation.'\n\nOur request to join Britain as Allies has been denied. The British government is unwilling to antagonise Germany further, and will not jeopardise the current peace."
 soviet.16.d:0 "The Supreme Soviet has received a formal request from the Tuvan parliament for membership in the Soviet Union. They will be organised as the Tuvan Autonomous Oblast in the Russian SFSR."
 soviet.17.d:0 "A thorough revision of the defensive fortifications along our western border regions has been completed, and convicts from our corrective labour camps stand ready to begin work. Soon the Stalin Line will live up to its glorious namesake!"
 soviet.61.t:0 "Soviets honour the pact"
 finland.2.d:0 "Finland and the Soviet Union are at war. After only a few decades of sovereignty, we now risk once again becoming the subject of one of our neighbours.\n\nThe threat of our enemy extends beyond our borders, however. Our neighbours in Sweden are still retaining a neutral stance towards the Soviet Union, but could perhaps be convinced to join us in defending our mutual legacy and secure their own strategic buffer."
 finland.3.d:0 "Our neighbour Finland has refused to give in to pressures from the Soviet Union, and the nations are now in a state of war. Although no formal alliance has been agreed upon between our countries, the Finnish government has requested that Sweden contribute to a joint defence of Åland, which remains largely Swedish-speaking and strategically important to both countries.\n\nWhile the government remains divided on what steps we should take to help Finland, the public support for their defence is notable. How far are we willing to go to protect our fellow Nordic counties from eastern aggression?"
 finland.4.a:0 "Let's hope they realise their mistake before it's too late."
 finland.5.d:0 "The Swedish government has been unwilling to join us in the war against the Soviet Union, but public support among our neighbours is still high, and many volunteers from the other Nordic countries have offered to join our ranks to aid the war effort. Although less than we hoped, at least there is some popular awareness about the threat we are facing."
 finland.6.d:0 "Our request to the Swedish government for a joint defence of Åland has been met above expectations. Sweden has joined us in war against the Soviet Union, refusing to remain neutral in the face of such a blatant threat. Despite internal disagreements, they will now fight with us side by side to secure continued Finnish sovereignty."
 japan.8.t:0 "Germany Recalls Advisers"
 japan.8.d:0 "The Germans have agreed to recall all of their advisers from China. They should be boarding planes bound for Berlin even now. Germany recognises that the future of Greater East Asia belongs to Japan, not China."
 japan.9.d:0 "The Germans have refused to recall their advisers from China, despite the fact that their military mission interferes directly with our plans for East Asia! Do they not see that this erodes the foundation for our nations to build diplomacy on? Can the Germans even be trusted?"
 japan.9.a:0 "Then their advisers will die with the rest of the Chinese."
 romania.6.d:0 "We have lost so much territory to our rapacious neighbours. Still, there are opportunities to recover some of the lost land, with interest. All we have to do is pick the right side. "
 hungary.2.d:0 "Germany has recognised the validity of our claim, as we knew they would, and Northern Transylvania has been returned to Hungary. This is a historic moment!"
 hungary.3.d:0 "Germany has not only recognised the validity of our claim, but they have decided that all of Transylvania is to be returned to Hungarian control! This is more than we had dared hope for."
 hungary.4.d:0 "Germany recognised the validity of our claim and awarded Northern Transylvania to us, but Romania has stubbornly refused to accept their decision!"
 hungary.5.d:0 "Germany recognised the validity of our claim and awarded all of Transylvania to us, but Romania has stubbornly refused to accept this decision!"
 italy.2.d:0 "Defiant to the last, King Zog has rejected our ultimatum. He and his advisers are now trying to scrape together whatever pitiful defences Albania can muster. We must occupy Tirana and put an end to this farce!"
 usa.1.d:0 "As American mobilises for war, we have received an unusual request. Amelia Earhart, the famous aviator who successfully circumvented the globe not long ago, wishes to enlist in the Army Air Corps as a fighter pilot. She has demonstrated considerable skill in mock dogfights, but there are many within the military establishment who frown on the idea of a having a woman flying combat missions. Should we make an exception in her case and let her join?"
 usa.3.t:0 "American Fleet in Pearl Harbour"
 usa.3.d:0 "The diplomatic and economic sanctions we have suffered from the United States appears to have been the beginning of something more threatening. The American Pacific Fleet has been stationed in the naval base in Pearl Harbour, Hawaii, clearly signalling that the Americans will maintain a strong presence in the Pacific and continue supporting our enemies. Striking against the base at this point may give us the element of surprise."
 usa.4.b:0 "This is clearly more favourable to the US, and unacceptable."
 usa.7.d:0 "Since the office of President of the United States was first established, no president has ruled for three consecutive terms. However, in light of the precarious state of the world and international developments in the last few years, President Roosevelt has decided to break with tradition and run for a third term. Republican Wendell Willkie, characterised as a dark horse candidate with a background as an industrialist with limited political experience, has been critical both of Roosevelt's economic interventionism and his justifications for running for a third term.\n\nAlthough the candidates have much in common in their foreign policies and Willkie wants to retain some form of the New Deal, many still consider this election a determining point for the future of American democracy."
 usa.8.d:0 "President Landon put a stop to the Democrats' continued New Deal reforms four years ago, choosing to rely on the nation's strength lying in industrial companies such as those he helped establish prior to his presidency. Roosevelt, who has continued to campaign in favour of completing the programs he originally planned for his second term, is now running for president again. While he remains a popular candidate, Landon has continued to criticise his efforts to concentrate power in the hands of the president, and has accordingly avoided similar policies himself.\n\nThreats abroad, both to our own nation and others, remain a reality and neither candidate is in favour of the United States turning a blind eye to them. The question is who will lead the arsenal of democracy through these dire times."
 news.11.d:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] has been concentrating significant forces along its border to [ROM.GetNameDef], and today Moscow issued an ultimatum to the Romanian government, calling for the immediate transfer of Bessarabia to its control. The region once belonged to the Russian Empire, which [SOV.GetNameDef] sees as sufficient legal basis for their demands.\n\nIn a defiant move, Bucharest has chosen to reject all Soviet territorial demands, and the Romanian army has been given the order for a complete mobilisation. \n\nInternational observers expect Soviet forces to cross the border at any moment."

 news.14.d:0 "In a press release earlier today, Moscow announced the formal annexation of [TAN.GetNameDef]. \n\nThe Supreme Soviet agreed to a request from the Tuvan parliament for membership in the USSR. \n\nThe small Tuvan People's Republic, which had only been officially recognised by the Soviet Union and Mongolia, will be organised as an autonomous oblast."

They have given the Polish Government an assurance to this effect.'"

An agreement was reached in which Germany annexes the Sudetenland, but will not pursue any further territorial gains in Europe.\n\nMr. Chamberlain spoke to crowds in London:\n'For the second time a Prime Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honour.

The naval base at Pearl Harbour, former headquarters of the US Pacific Fleet, has also fallen.\n\nAccording to witnesses, beleaguered American sailors and Marines retreated to Ford Island, where they continued to offer stubborn resistance until they were subjected to an intense artillery and aerial bombardment. With this island under its control, the long reach of the Imperial Japanese Navy has become greater still."
 news.125.d:0 "After a period of heavy bombardment, it has now been confirmed that the city of Calcutta in India has fallen to advancing Japanese forces. Even while sporadic fighting was still occurring in the outskirts of the city, a victory parade was quickly organised on Chowringhee avenue.\n\nMembers of the Indian National Army, a military outfit organised by the Japanese and dedicated to the liberation of India from Britain, took part in the parade and drew wild cheers from the crowds. With the fall of Calcutta, many predict that all of British India will soon follow."
 news.129.d:0 "British forces have advanced into Berlin, and the War Cabinet has announced the successful capture of the German capital after a pitched battle. Striking at dawn, British commandos seized the Tempelhof Airport while armoured columns advanced along the Frankfurter Allee.\n\nWith the Reich Chancellery under British control, fighting in the city has largely ended. The current status of the German government remains unclear, but it is believed that at least some elements of it escaped the city before its fall."
 news.130.d:0 "French forces have successfully stormed the German capital, which fell after a series of pitched battles within the city limits. A large group of Waffen-SS soldiers barricaded themselves in the Olympiastadion, which eventually fell after a determined attack by Foreign Legionnaires supported by artillery.\n\nThe French tricolour can now be seen flying over the Reich Chancellery, and although sporadic fighting is still being reported from some suburbs, most of Berlin is believed to have been cleared of organised resistance."
 news.131.d:0 "Desperate fighting has been reported from Berlin, the capital of Germany, but it is now believed that the city is completely in Polish hands. After advancing along the Frankfurter Allee, the Poles reached the Alexanderplatz which was the scene of a pitched battle.\n\nElsewhere in the city, the Brandenburg Gate collapsed, supposedly after being rammed by a Polish tank, and the Kroll Opera House was levelled by an artillery barrage after its stubborn SS defenders refused to surrender. The red and white of the Polish flag now flies above the Reichstag, and the last pockets of resistance have been dealt with."
 news.132.d:0 "Allied forces recently entered Rome after the surrender of its garrison, and the city is now under military occupation. Most historical landmarks remain intact, having weathered yet another battle for control over the city. For now at least, Allied troops have stayed outside Vatican City at the request of the Holy See.\n\nThe fall of Rome is an important milestone in the Italian campaign, and some are wondering if this means an end of the organised resistance to the advancing Allied armies on the peninsula."
 news.133.d:0 "Forces from France recently entered Rome after the city's remaining Italian garrison melted away into the surrounding countryside. The French troops moved quickly to occupy all significant government buildings, and a 'triumph' was held along the Via del Corso by a long procession of marching soldiers and armoured vehicles.\n\nWith the fall of Rome, the ability of Italy to continue the war is put into question. Outside observers expect that the Italian government, who fled the city just before its fall, will soon begin surrender negotiations."
 news.134.d:0 "It has now been confirmed that Paris, the capital of France, has been liberated from German occupation. Allied forces have entered the city, and the remaining German garrison has surrendered. Parisians could be seen cheering their liberators as they marched down the Champs Élysées, even while there were rumours of German sniper fire in some parts of the city.\n\nIt was feared that the Germans would employ a strategy of scorched earth and leave Paris a burning ruin, but the city's landmarks appear to have been spared. Indeed, the French tricolour can even now be seen flying from the Eiffel Tower."
 news.135.d:0 "American forces have entered Tokyo, and the US War Department recently announced an end to major combat operations in the city. Fighting was reported as heavy, particularly in the vicinity of the Imperial Palace which was defended by fanatical members of the Imperial Guard, even though the Emperor is believed to have left the city before the American assault began.\n\nWith the fall of Tokyo, experts predict that organised resistance on the rest of the Japanese Home Islands will soon crumble. Peace negotiations are expected to begin shortly, unless Japanese hardliners convince the Emperor to continue the fight to the death."
 news.144.d:0 "The communist surge continues, with Soviet forces recently having completed the capture of London. A parade was quickly organised by the Red Army, even before the last pockets of resistance in the city had been fully dealt with.\n\nCommunist sympathisers have been quick to turn in the names of known anti-communists to the Soviet military authorities, and a People's Court has convened at Trafalgar Square to punish the worst offenders."
 news.145.d:0 "Fires continue to rage in central London, but it is believed that most of the city's German occupiers have either fallen in battle or been captured by the advancing Soviet forces. Crowds have emerged on the streets to cheer the Russians on as they move to deal with the last stubborn holdouts.\n\nCollaborators have been dealt with harshly, and the Soviets have organised an interim council to administrate the liberated city until further notice. Critics have observed that the members of this council all appear to have been drawn from the Communist Party of Great Britain."
 news.150.d:0 "The Yugoslavian government's attempts to co-operate with Germany has had many opponents within the nation's military, which today resulted in a coup overthrowing the reigning ruler and placing King Peter II on the throne.\n\nThe nation has cut many of its ties with Germany and the new regime seems prepared to risk a war rather than co-operate."

With both Britain and France threatening to mobilise if Germany proceeded with the plan, it quickly became clear that this level of resistance was unexpected. Germany was not prepared to face both countries in all-out war.\n\nAs it stands, the Rhineland will remain a demilitarised zone as dictated by the treaty unless Germany goes to war."

With supporters of Trotsky's theories taking the lead, the groundwork for the Fourth International was laid.\n\nAlthough it is still unclear what impact these efforts of organise will have on the international political stage, the news appear to have stirred Stalin's suspicions. He has suspected many high-ranking members of the party and the military to secretly support Trotsky, and many of them are still alive. With his paranoia back in full force, he has grown increasingly reclusive. His distrust and instability have caused a crisis in the Soviet government. At this rate, the nation will be plunged into civil war."

 election.2.d:0 "In the upcoming election, support for [Root.GetRulingParty] is still high, the people having confidence in [Root.GetLeader]'s leadership. However, the party's pursuit of increasing [Root.GetName]'s focus on military matters has not been entirely popular with the public, with a significant segment of the citizens considering this ill-advised jingoism. War is yet to reach our border and few would like to see [Root.GetName] take aggressive action. Co-operating with other major parties who share our concerns for the safety of the nation, we will still be able to rule after the election, albeit with diminished support."
 election.3.b:0 "Many are still in favour of diplomatic solutions."
 election.4.d:1 "An aggressively nationalist sentiment has grown in [Root.GetName], giving rise to several parties promoting fascist ideals: a state enforcing its power through force. One of these in particular has won favour in the current election, leading to discussions within the [Root.GetRulingParty] party about whether or not we should try to co-operate with them in forming our government. While they openly reject the democratic ideals that are the foundation of our state, the fact that they choose to participate in the election itself lends some credibility to our views and acknowledging their public support may keep them away from taking violent action."
 election.5.d:0 "The communist movement in [Root.GetName], fuelled by broad dissatisfaction among the working class and radical trends among academics, has grown large enough to lead to the formation of several parties. After one of these has gained considerable support in the current election, politicians in [Root.GetRulingParty] have started debating whether or not to seek their support in forming a government. Although they consider our democratic institutions to be little more than bourgeois tyranny, they seem eager to make the changes they want to see through co-operating with the government rather than overthrowing it."
 election.6.d:0 "Politics in [Root.GetName] have grown increasingly radicalised. Where there was once broad support for the parties which supported democratic ideals and [Root.GetName]'s representative institutions, more voters have turned to the political extremes in this election. The parties in the political middle, even if they choose to set aside their differences, no longer form a majority. To avoid a weak minority government, we have no choice but to co-operate with either fascists or communists."
 election.7.d:1 "Accepting the fascists into our political coalition has had an impact on our foreign policy. Despite their vehement nationalism, they have sympathisers abroad who approve of the influence they've been given in [Root.GetName]. Totalitarian governments of similar ideological leanings see us as potential allies. Maintaining ties to these nations, no matter the distaste [Root.GetRulingParty] may have for their ideals, may be necessary to retain the support of the fascists backing our government."
 election.8.d:0 "Communists often consider themselves to be part of an international revolution, and our choice to accept them as partners in our government has drawn the attention of many of their international allies. Representatives of communist parties maintain close ties to nations which have abandoned our form of government in favour of a dictatorship of the proletariat, ties which we may need to acknowledge in [Root.GetAdjective] foreign policy if we wish to retain their support."
 election.11.d:0 "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favour of a fascist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."
 election.13.t:0 "Election: Magnate Favours Fascism"
 election.16.d:0 "With the present election, the opposition, insofar as it exists, has criticised the increasingly authoritarian reign of [Root.GetRulingParty]. They question whether the electorate has any power at all, or if it's all just for show.\n\nHowever, the support for [Root.GetLeader] appears to remain high, and although the circumstances of the election are questioned by international community, it has not been contested domestically. It appears that even if [Root.GetName] is no longer ruled by the people, the people support their ruler... at least the ones who made it to the ballots."
 political.3.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretence of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to co-operate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labour unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organised enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 political.7.a:0 "The higher-ups may harbour unspoken sympathies."
 political.8.d:1 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defence. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the saviour of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumoured to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organisations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 political.12.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbours and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 political.13.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organised, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains sceptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organised demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.17.d:0 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favour of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."
 political.26.d:0 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamour for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."
 political.28.d:1 "The terrible civil war that has devastated our land draws to an end, and we have finally reached a political agreement. We now see eye to eye with our fellow [Root.GetAdjective]s, and together we will rebuild our great nation.

Tearing down the cult of personality he built up will take time, but the people know now at least that he was not immortal.\n\n One of the few survivors who managed to escape was Ivan Konev.

 yugoslavia.1.d:0 "The anti-Axis sentiment in Yugoslavia, which we have long tried to balance in an effort to make the country remain neutral and continue our co-operation with the current leadership, has reached a critical point with the nation's new efforts to co-operate with Germany.

The capital of Tokyo, although expected to be the target of firebombing, was never assumed to be a prioritised target of this new weapon.

Those who try to gain his trust have further fuelled this idea to cast themselves in a better light.\n\nThe current situation is one of exceptional irony: the distrust within the current administration has rendered it unsustainable, and a coup is now imminent. Some party members are arguing that re-inviting Trotsky and turning the purges on the Stalinists could minimise the damage of the civil war that will ensue. Can this plan, which has been the General Secretary's greatest fear for years, truly be executed?"
