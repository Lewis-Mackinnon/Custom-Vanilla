 HUN_treaty_of_triannon_desc:0 "The Treaty of Trianon is, in many ways, similar to the Treaty of Versailles, crippling our military and preventing re-armament. Seeing it altered or abolished must be our premier goal. We can do this by seeking a Rapprochement with the Little Entente, proposing the Bled Agreement, or by renouncing it altogether. The last option will be widely considered as very aggressive and may provoke a strong response."
