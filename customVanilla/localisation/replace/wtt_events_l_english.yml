A number of Wehrmacht generals have rallied behind the well-known Field Marshal August von Mackensen, who has put in motion plans aiming to depose Hitler, and to remove the Nazi party from Germany.\n\nWith the split in the German high command becoming clearly apparent even abroad, foreign powers have elected not to protest against the remilitarisation, more concerned with the growing internal German instability. The aging Field Marshal has moved quickly, already establishing a provisional government, to which scores have flocked in their opposition to the Nazi government.\n\nThe military coup is already well on its way."
