 HUN_strengthen_the_monarchists_desc:0 "The first step in returning Hungary to its previous prestige is to strengthen those parties that clamour for a return to a monarchy."
 HUN_protect_czechoslovakia_desc:0 "Czechoslovakia has, since its independence, grown powerful and industrious, but their lands are eyed greedily by their neighbours. We will offer them our protection against these threats, either by welcoming them once again as an integral part of our Empire, or by granting them association status."
 HUN_reclaim_the_empire_desc:0 "To finalise our de jure territorial demands, we must claim the various titles in Germany, Italy and Palestine that our Habsburg monarch has to his name."
 HUN_rapproachement_with_little_entente_desc:0 "Hostile ideologies surround us, and we must re-affirm our ties to our Little Entente neighbours. We will ask them if they wish to see us re-arm."

 HUN_soviet_hungarian_military_academy_desc:0 "Our army is nothing without its leadership. The Soviets have far more experience in military matters, so it may be beneficial to co-operate with them in the training of our finest military minds. To this end we will establish a military academy with the most skilled instructors from both our nations."
 HUN_the_revolutionary_council_desc:0 "The Comintern has abandoned the struggle against imperialism, instead opting to settle for co-existence. If the workers of the world are to be free, we must carry the torch of Marx and Lenin forward - even against the Soviet Union, if need be."
 HUN_industrial_revitalization:0 "Industrial Revitalisation"
 HUN_support_urbanization:0 "Support Urbanisation"
 HUN_reintegrate_the_railroads_desc:0 "The railway networks spanning the old Austria-Hungarian empire have become fragmented since its dissolution into independent nations. We should approach the other former constituent states and propose a reintegration of our railway networks, to improve the infrastructure overall."
 HUN_expand_the_manfred_weiss_steel_works_desc:0 "The massive Manfed Weiss Steel Works have been an integral defence contractor since the Great War saw a huge expansion of the facilities.

 HUN_expand_the_aluminum_industry:0 "Expand the Aluminium Industry"
 HUN_expand_the_aluminum_industry_desc:0 "We require all available resources, both for export and for domestic use. Our aluminium industry, though already expansive, has further room for improvement, and we should direct resources to this end immediately."
 HUN_boost_hungarian_aviation_industry_desc:0 "Our industrial base must be strengthened to allow for the production of new aeroplane models in sufficient quantities to gain mastery of the air."
 HUN_secret_rearmament_desc:0 "The restrictions imposed on us by the Treaty of Trianon prohibit us from increasing the size of our army. Even so, the world's political climate is becoming ever more turbulent, and conflict looms over the horizon. We cannot remain defenceless, and we must begin to re-arm even if it means secretly breaking the stipulations of the peace treaty imposed on us after the Great War."
 HUN_bled_agreement_desc:0 "Small-scale secret re-armament will not suffice. We must reach out to our neighbours and request redress of the treaty imposed on us after the Great War. Hungary has an equal right to armament."

 HUN_assault_gun_focus_desc:0 "Rather than focus on full-fledged tanks, we will instead rely on assault guns to aid our infantry in affecting breakthroughs, as a more cost-effective alternative."
 HUN_armored_warfare:0 "Armoured Warfare"
 HUN_armored_warfare_desc:0 "Our motorised divisions will require armoured support to be truly effective. We must pour more resources into the development of new armour designs."

 HUN_submarines_desc:0 "Submarines came close to beating the most powerful navy on the planet in the last war. We can not be taken seriously as a modern navy if we do not possess submarines of our own."
 HUN_carriers_desc:0 "The battleship is a relic of a time long gone. The future of naval warfare is the carrier and the aeroplane. We will be at the forefront of this development."
 ROM_form_peasant_militias_desc:0 "With the communist ideals that we take from our neighbour comes the duty of every man to defend his comrades, his country, and the revolution."
 ROM_basing_rights_for_soviet_union_desc:0 "We know the Soviets desire our territory, but we might be able to preclude any hostilities by offering our neighbour basing rights."
 ROM_trade_treaty_with_germany_desc:0 "We know of the German economic interest in our country. Arranging increased delivery of goods such as oil will enable us to request German aid in modernising our military."
 ROM_invite_german_advisors:0 "Invite German Advisers"
 ROM_invite_german_advisors_desc:0 "German aid is essential if we want to modernise our military. They possess the technical know-how that we require, and so we should request the help of their advisers."
 ROM_license_german_equipment_desc:0 "German equipment is superior to our own, but perhaps we could obtain the licences to produce these weapons, ourselves."
 ROM_renew_the_romanian_polish_alliance_desc:0 "Our old ties with Poland have cooled in recent years. As the threats surrounding us have not diminished, and the global political situation grows ever more tumultuous, the time has come to revive our alliance with our northern neighbour."
 ROM_the_cordon_sanitaire_desc:0 "We are bordered by dangerous ideologies both to the east and to the west. Together with our neighbours to the north and south, we will establish a barrier, quarantining these dogmas and preventing them from advancing any further."

 ROM_national_defense_industry:0 "National Defence Industry"
 ROM_danubian_transport_network_desc:0 "Our transport capabilities alongside the Danube can be drastically improved upon, both by utilising the river itself more effectively and the way it is connected to our road and rail networks."
 ROM_invite_foreign_motor_companies_desc:0 "Rather than expend resources on increasing production of unproven domestic automobile designs, we would benefit more from producing tried and tested foreign designs under licence."
 ROM_hunedoara_steel_works_desc:0 "To feed the needs of our arms production the great steel works in Transylvania must be modernised and drastically expanded."
 ROM_invest_in_the_iar_desc:0 "It is critical to keep up with the demands of a modern air force. Our industry must be capable not only of building the machines we require in the first place, but also of doing so at a pace fast enough to replace operational losses."
 ROM_puppet_bulgaria_desc:0 "Warmongering Bulgaria has long been a thorn in their neighbours' sides. We must subjugate them once and for all."
 ROM_militarize_the_sentinels:0 "Militarise the Sentinels"
 ROM_militarize_the_sentinels_desc:0 "The paramilitary Sentinels could easily be transformed into a fully-fledged military organisation, provided we allocate the appropriate resources."
 ROM_revise_the_constitution_desc:0 "The constitution must be rewritten to solidify the King's position as the nation's leader. Furthermore, dangerous far-right movements can be undermined by providing a safer alternative in the King's Sentinel of the Motherland youth organisation."
 ROM_appoint_soviet_friendly_government_desc:0 "The future of Romania hinges on good relations with our communist eastern neighbour. We must appoint a government that understands this reality."
 ROM_securitate_desc:0 "We must establish an expansive secret police organisation to subdue internal threats to our new government."

 ROM_the_armored_division_desc:0 "Tanks are the way forward, and we must establish dedicated divisions that utilise the strengths of these new weapons."
 ROM_mobile_tank_destroyers_desc:0 "We do not possess the industry to out-produce our enemies in terms of tanks. We must instead focus on producing weapons that can nullify the enemy's superiority in armoured units."
 ROM_coastal_defense_navy:0 "Coastal Defence Navy"

 ROM_coastal_defense_ships_tech_tt:0 "Enables §HCoastal Defence Ships§!\n§HHeavy Cruisers§!\n    Armour: §G+20%§!\n    Naval Firepower: §G+10%§!\n    Production Cost: §G-10%§!"
 ROM_coastal_defense_ships_desc:0 "New designs will have to be created for ships that excel at coastal defence duties."

 ROM_torpedo_bombers_desc:0 "We can make up our naval weakness by appropriating a portion of our air forces to naval duties. This will require a new aeroplane model that can carry a torpedo."
 ROM_expand_the_marine_regiment_desc:0 "Mastery of the Black Sea opens up opportunities for new avenues of attack. Naval invasions are now a viable option, requiring the creation of new models of transports, as well as dedicated marine divisions that can specialise in this form of warfare."
 CZE_fortification_studies_desc:0 "The need to fortify our border is clear, but the question is how? The French have recently constructed an incredible fortified line of their own, the Maginot Line, and by sending a delegation to study their methods it should be possible to solve our own border defence problems."
 CZE_industrial_legacy_desc:0 "Skoda Works was the largest arms manufacturer in Austria-Hungary, and since our independence they have branched out to become a leader in many fields of industry. Having such a high concentration of both expertise and heavy industry greatly aids all industrial endeavours."
 CZE_favor_czechs_2_desc:1 "Further investment focussed into Bohemia and Moravia will improve our industry far more than a broader approach."
 CZE_balanced_3:1 "Local Specialisation"
 CZE_balanced_3_desc:1 "With the continued investment in the industry of all regions of the country, some areas have begun to specialise in certain goods and services. We can encourage this further."
 CZE_arms_exports_3_desc:1 "Demand for weapons is at an all-time high, and so is the output of our production lines. To support weapon sales, we can publicly declare that we will sell to anyone with the cash to pay for it - and then use the money to invest in our own re-armament."
 CZE_czech_socialism_desc:1 "Central control is certainly great for the economy, but perhaps it is possible to have too much of a good thing. By decentralising slightly into both Czech and Slovakian soviets, greater overall unity can prevail!"
 CZE_the_romanian_question_desc:0 "Romania stands between us and our friend and protector, the Soviet Union. Since they will not permit the passage of Soviet troops to aid in our defence, a more drastic solution must be considered."
 CZE_the_polish_division_desc:0 "Not only does Poland refuse the passage of Soviet troops in the event we need their help, they still harbour resentment over our liberation of the Zaolzie region and may well seek revenge. A pre-emptive defence would be prudent."
 CZE_german_ally_desc:0 "Germany is a fellow Fascist power, a fellow traveller on the road to glory. Together we will make the world rotate around the Prague-Berlin Axis!"
 CZE_german_leanings_desc:0 "German power is on the rise, and their stated goal is to unite all German-speaking people within one Reich.

 YUG_ban_slovene_nationalist_parties_desc:1 "Any clamour for independence must be stamped down on for the good of our nation. Nationalist political elements will be outlawed and their supporters persecuted lest they weaken us internally."
 YUG_all_yugoslavian_regiments_desc:1 "Though our peoples may be diverse, all must serve to defend our nation. We shall make no distinction of ethnicity when organising our regiments."
 YUG_crush_the_ustasa_desc:1 "The Croatian ultra-nationalist movement Ustasa has become an increasing thorn in our sides. It can no longer be deemed anything other than a terrorist organisation, and must be rooted out for the good of the nation."
 YUG_local_militias_desc:1 "The people will be encouraged to form up militias in defence of their homeland. This will enable larger parts of the population to be eligible for recruitment to military service, later."
 YUG_join_allies_desc:1 "In our fledgling nation's brief history the Western Democracies have always supported us. We must make our allegiance known in public, so that we may rely on their military strength should we become the target of our neighbours."
 YUG_claim_macedonia_desc:1 "Some parts of Macedonia are still outside our borders. As all Macedonians are slavs, they belong in our nation."
 YUG_recognize_the_soviet_union:0 "Recognise the Soviet Union"
 YUG_recognize_the_soviet_union_desc:1 "While we have historically refused to recognise the Bolshevik state in the East, the time has perhaps come for us to reconsider our stance on the matter. While the Western Democracies seem too weak to defend the minor powers, the Soviet Union may well prove a more reliable friend."
 YUG_federal_defense_council:0 "Federal Defence Council"
 YUG_federal_defense_council_desc:1 "All regions must have a voice in the defence of our great nation. This will go a long way to ensuring that the most voices practically possible are heard, and that discrimination will not stem merit in its infancy."
 YUG_industrialization_program:0 "Industrialisation Program"
 YUG_industrialization_program_desc:1 "A program of rapid industrialisation is required if we are to keep up with our neighbours' re-armament programs."
 YUG_develop_slovenian_industry_desc:1 "Though long neglected, Slovenia has ample space to create a new industrial centre. This will furthermore please the Slovenes greatly."
 YUG_improve_serbian_rail_network_desc:1 "We can omit building up the railway networks in the outlying provinces. The most important areas are the centre and east."
 YUG_modernize_the_air_force:0 "Modernise the Air Force"
 YUG_modernize_the_air_force_desc:1 "Our air force is horribly outdated. If we are to have any reasonable chance of defending the airspace over our own territory, much less bring the fight to the enemy, we require a drastic program of modernisation."
 YUG_local_developers_desc:1 "We must increase support for local aircraft development, allowing us greater control over the resulting aeroplane models and providing a stimulus for our industry."
 YUG_heavy_fighter_project_desc:1 "Our fighters must be able to support the more vulnerable bomber airplanes. This requires heavier armament and longer range at the cost of some speed and manoeuvrability."
 YUG_license_production:0 "Licence Production"

 YUG_armored_cavalry:0 "Armoured Cavalry"
 YUG_armored_cavalry_desc:1 "Slapping armour on our troop transports greatly improves their survivability, fighting strength, and morale. This, however, requires a new type of at least partly-tracked vehicle that can carry the added weight without becoming stuck in the terrain, while also sporting weaponry of its own."
 YUG_tank_conversions_desc:1 "While we may require tanks now, we may require self-propelled artillery or tank destroyers based on the same chassis next month. Our armoured equipment must remain flexible and adaptable to our current needs."
 YUG_modern_tanks_desc:1 "Through the addition of large-calibre main weaponry, armoured technology has developed well beyond the simple intention of safely transporting forces from point A to point B. We must develop our own version of modern tanks to be able to compete with our neighbours."
 YUG_tank_licenses:0 "Tank Licences"
 YUG_tank_licenses_desc:1 "Rather than spend our limited resources on developing our own tank models, we could much more efficiently simply produce foreign models under licence."
 YUG_anti_tank_defenses:0 "Anti-tank Defences"
 YUG_anti_tank_defenses_desc:1 "As the tank has taken centre field in modern warfare new developments are required in the field of anti-tank field guns, allowing our infantry to take out these armoured behemoths."

 YUG_supremacy_of_defense:0 "Supremacy of Defence"
 YUG_supremacy_of_defense_desc:1 "Hemmed in by enemies on all sides, we must hold out long enough for our allies to take the heat off us. The development of new military doctrines must focus on the defence of our homeland."
 YUG_expand_the_split_shipyards_desc:1 "Our pre-existing shipbuilding industry in Dalmatia is a prime candidate for expansion, and has ample facilities allowing for larger warships. However, Croatian clamour for increased autonomy might well lead us to lose direct control over the facilities eventually."
 YUG_contest_the_adriatic_desc:1 "The defence of our shores begins in the sea that lies beyond them. We must develop new naval tactics and strategies to wrest control or at least contest the Adriatic Sea."
 YUG_naval_bombers_desc:1 "The Adriatic is long, but narrow, making it easily accessible to aeroplanes based off our airfields. By developing dedicated naval bomber models this could significantly improve the chances of our navy against more powerful adversaries."
