 MEX_focus_blue_water_navy_desc:0 "Mexico has never been a naval power. In colonial times, our Spanish overlords needed all their ships to face the British. During the independence struggle and civil wars following it, all our attentions were focussed inwards. After America overtook us and became a Great Power, there was no point trying to contest the seas. But perhaps in these turbulent times Mexico will need a powerful navy."
 MEX_focus_tank_workshops_desc:0 "Our aircraft designer, TNCA, experimented with armoured fighting vehicles during the Great War, creating a prototype based on the British rhombus designs. We should restart these experiments and create a tank workshop."
 MEX_focus_weapons_modernisation:0 "Weapons Modernisation"
 MEX_focus_agricultural_credit_bank_desc:0 "The Banco de Crédito Agricola will help speed up the land reform programme by giving loans to ejido farmers with which to buy machinery and other capital goods. Alberto J. Pani is a veteran of the finance industry who can lead this bank and help Mexico expand her productive capacity."
 MEX_focus_rural_schools_desc:0 "The schools are where we turn the raw material of illiterate peasants into patriotic citizens willing to fight injustice and strengthen the Fatherland. The Escuelas Regionales Campesinas will revolutionise the peasants, teach them technical skills and make them self-reliant."
 MEX_focus_rent_freeze_desc:0 "The urban labourers are a key constituent in the new Mexico we are building. They were mobilised into Red Battalions during the Revolution and now seek the compensation they were promised. One area of immediate concern should be the parasitic landlords extracting rents from these hardworking wealth creators."
 MEX_focus_ejido_worker_militias_desc:0 "The land reform promised in the Constitution of 1917 has seen slow progress. Often, landlords use thugs and private armies to intimidate their tenants to prevent redistribution. Let us organise the peasants, farmers and laborers into communal militias to protect the gains we are making against injustice."
 MEX_focus_party_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "President Cárdenas was elected on a platform of agrarian reform thanks to the support of worker and peasant organisations. We have implemented the reforms and now have a proud socialist nation ready to fight injustice on the international stage."
 MEX_focus_liberalize_the_banking_sector:0 "Liberalise the Banking Sector"
 MEX_focus_strike_breaking_desc:0 "Unionisation is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution of 1917, but attacks on property are criminal and should be treated as such. Withdrawing labour from a critical industry could even be perceived as treasonous in a time of crisis."
 MEX_focus_urban_development_desc:0 "The cities are the centre of economic activity and therefore must have their needs prioritised over the backwards rural states. We will build up the road and rail systems in Mexico City and the other major urban areas, and in doing so the wealth of Mexico will increase even more."
 MEX_focus_privatization:0 "Privatisation"
 MEX_focus_privatization_desc:0 "The ejido system places restrictions on the use of land, depending upon the use intended by the government. Why should the state force farmers into subsistence rather than growing cash crops for export? We can make Mexico wealthier if we break up the communal farms and allow real development to take place. Antiquated notions of self-reliance only stand in the way of progress and globalisation."
 MEX_focus_support_general_cedillo_desc:0 "The Northern General Saturnino Cedillo and other caudillos like him need assurances that their autonomy will be respected by the government. The rapid centralisation of power under presidents Calles and Cárdenas has allowed us to bring massive weight to bear on the problems facing the nation, so further dispossession of the caudillos is not needed."
 MEX_focus_northern_steel_plants_desc:0 "The most industrialised region in Mexico outside the capital is the northern border with America. Cities along the Rio Grande such as Matamoros and Ciudad Juarez enjoy close economic ties to their counterparts over the border like Brownsville and El Paso. We should exploit the superior infrastructure in the area to further develop our heavy industries."
 MEX_focus_royal_dutch_shell_desc:0 "Royal Dutch Shell is a British and Dutch firm holding 60% of Mexican oil concessions. By compromising with the foreign oil companies on the matter of labour disputes, we can come to an accomodation that is beneficial to us both."
 MEX_focus_nationalize_the_oil_fields:0 "Nationalise the Oil Fields"
 MEX_focus_oppose_yanqui_imperialism_desc:0 "Having rightfully reclaimed the natural resources of our country, the foreigners are now clamouring for compensation, but the concessions were essentially stolen from the Mexican people in their time of weakness under the dictator Díaz. Why should we pay a thief for returning stolen property?"
 MEX_focus_interior_defence_plan:0 "Interior Defence Plan"
 MEX_focus_interior_defence_plan_desc:0 "It's true that the Yanquis have a numerical and technological advantage over us, but we have knowledge of the terrain, support from the people, and time and space to establish a strong defence. We will bleed the enemy in the deserts and mountains using hit-and-run tactics, defence-in-depth, and hidden strongpoints."
 MEX_focus_compensation_desc:0 "The oil concessions were legally sold to Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil. We cannot fault the foreign firms for seeking a profit. We should maintain the integrity of our legal system by compensating the foreigners for nationalising the concessions."
 MEX_focus_liberty_and_justice_for_all_desc:0 "The Americans are now the greatest economic power in history. The Soviets may be fast industrialising, and the Germans may understand war better, but America's advantages are complimented by her insistence upon freedom for the individual and reliance on institutions over brute force. Extending our economic ties to a military alliance would only be natural."
 MEX_focus_march_southwards_desc:0 "Mexico lost the provinces to her south after the independence struggle. The incompetent Mexican Empire was a blight on our history, but we can rectify its mistakes. The Southern states are critical to our defence and we will reclaim them."
 MEX_focus_plan_of_agua_prieta_desc:0 "The Revolution against Díaz and the vicious infighting afterwards lasted a decade. When the dust was settled, the victorious Northern generals met at Agua Prieta, Sonora, to lay out their plan for Mexico's future. They are a populist clique of modernisers and secularisers, or else a 'confederation of caciques' little better than bandit lords dividing their spoils, depending upon one's perspective."
 MEX_focus_repeal_the_calles_law_desc:0 "Calles incited the Cristeros to revolt by heavy-handed application of the anti-religious articles of the Constitution. The Calles Law humiliates the clergy by forbidding the wearing of clerical garb in public and imprisonment for religious figures who criticise the government. We agree that the Church's political influence needs curtailing but these are attacks on individual liberty, not Church power."
 MEX_focus_enforce_the_calles_law_desc:0 "The Cristero footsoldiers may not have been destroyed in the field, but in the years following their futile rebellion we hunted down their remaining leaders and sympathisers within the Church, decapitating their movement and ensuring no resurgence. The Church has no choice but to accept our demands against them. They will become another instrument of the state's power or we will continue decapitating them."
 MEX_focus_law_on_industrial_promotion_desc:0 "For many years, the Mexican states and federal government have sought to encourage development of new industries via tax exemptions. Oftentimes, the local regulations work against national interests by diverting capital to unimportant or inefficient areas. We need to rationalise our approach to industrial development with a centralised plan."
 MEX_focus_nafinsa_desc:0 "Nacional Financiera is a development bank established to encourage the industrialisation of Mexico. It has been especially important in the creation of new factories in the central Mexican states, such as chemical plants and metalworks in Mexico City."
 MEX_focus_television_innovators_desc:0 "Mexico has a surprisingly advanced electronics industry. Guillermo González Camarena and other members of the 'League of Radio Experiments' are experimenting with colour television transmissions. We could become world leaders in communications technology if we focus on these developments."
 MEX_focus_antidisestablishmentarianism_desc:0 "The True Faith has been abused by the 'Revolutionary' junta for decades now. Churches, monasteries and reliquaries are formally owned by the state, with clergymen requiring licences from the government to tend to their flocks. Some states have a single priest for tens of thousands of faithful. Let us drop this requirement and allow the Church to own property once again."
 MEX_focus_legion_of_christ_desc:1 "We are righting the wrongs of the 'Revolution' with the indefatigable spirit befitting agents of Christ, but we have only just begun. We need an organisation to seek out and punish the criminals who attacked the Holy Church. As it says in the Book of Exodus: take eye for eye, life for life."
 MEX_focus_reform_the_cristero_guard_desc:1 "The Cristeros valiantly defended the Church from the oppression of Calles the tyrant and a lot of them died as martyrs under the banner of Christ. Now that the power of the Holy Church has been restored, they must be reorganised in order to become the armed protectors of Christ."
 MEX_focus_revolutionary_women_desc:0 "Traditionally associated with domestic work, women have also performed industrial labour for decades in Mexico. The tobacco, coffee and clothing industries tend to hire a majority of women, although this has caused friction with the male-dominated trades union movement. Men already have a right to equal pay for equal work and a minimum wage - we should enforce this right for women, as well."
 MEX_focus_womens_suffrage_desc:0 "Many legislators and cabinet ministers of the Revolutionary governments opposed the extension of the right to vote for women because they believed women would be more easily swayed by the arguments of the clergy and would end the programme of secularisation. Whatever the case in the past, we cannot stand in the path of progress."
 MEX_focus_ban_political_militias_desc:0 "The left- and right-wing paramilitaries claim to be patriots fighting national traitors, but in truth they are pawns of foreign powers who seek to destabilise the country for nefarious ends. The government must clamp down on the fascist and communist militias."
 MEX_focus_depoliticised_army:0 "Depoliticised Army"
 trotsky_not_welcome_in_mexico:1 "The Political Climate is not Favourable to Trotsky"
 MEX_focus_revolutionary_class_war_desc:1 "Only the Proletariat, armed and organised as a class army, will be able to defend and propagate the ideals of the Revolution."
 MEX_focus_falangist_veterans_desc:0 "The Falangists are an organisation of fascist paramilitaries in Spain. They fight for God and Nation, although many of them are monarchists, which is regrettable. Nevertheless, we should make contact with the Falangist veterans of the Spanish Civil War and learn from their experiences."
 MEX_focus_hispanic_alliance_desc:1 "Our rulers are descended from the peninsulares, colonists who brought civilisation to the New World. Spain, with her strong tradition of Church power and landed elites, was once a source of legitimacy. Nowadays, Spain looks less and less like the leader of the Latin world. We must take up this mantle for ourselves and create stronger bonds across the continent using our Hispanicity as the building block."
 MEX_focus_coastal_defence_plan:0 "Coastal Defence Plan"
 MEX_focus_coastal_defence_plan_desc:0 "The Americans showed us in 1846 that, while we have deserts and mountains to give us strategic depth to our north, our littoral flanks are vulnerable to an amphibious invasion. We should add coastal defences to our Gulf and Pacific ports and cities."
 MEX_focus_rescind_the_mexican_cession_desc:0 "The vast lands lost to our Northern aggressor in 1848 continue to tantalise some Mexican nationalists. There are now millions of Hispanic people living in the United States, some descendents of original Mexican inhabitants, others more recent migrants. We should redeem the honour of Mexico by smashing the Yanqui aggressors and uniting the Mexican people!"
 ENG_chiefs_of_staff_committee_desc:1 "We must empower the heads of the various service branches to conduct this war as they consider is best. The Combined Chiefs of Staff, formed initially in 1923, will now be given the means to co-ordinate operations across the globe, reporting directly to the War Cabinet. This will greatly streamline planning for military operations."
 ENG_revisit_colonial_policy_desc:1 "The times are changing. It is clear that independence movements will only continue to spring up across the empire, and in ever-stronger incarnations. If we do not wish to be forced into pouring increasingly vast resources into suppressing these movements, then we must acknowledge that our Empire has run its course, and now must be allowed to find its own path into the world."
 ENG_foundations_for_an_indian_state_desc:2 "If it is to function as an independent state, we must see to increasing the industrialisation of India, as well as drastically restructuring their government. The challenges of governing an entire subcontinent are, as we have found, not simple ones, and India must be prepared if it is to succeed."
 ENG_the_three_nation_solution_desc:1 "Cultural and religious differences are extreme across the Indian subcontinent. Already, there are antagonisations between various groupings with different loyalties. Rather than lump them all in to a single state, perhaps the better solution would be to split the subcontinent up in a trio of states. Hindu India, Muslim Pakistan in the northwest, and Muslim Bangladesh in the northeast."
 ENG_withdraw_from_contested_territories_desc:0 "A number of territories across the globe, considered part of the British Overseas Territories, are claimed by neighbouring states. This causes diplomatic tensions, and so it may be better to reassess their status as under United Kingdom juristiction."
 ENG_self_government_for_the_mediterranean_desc:1 "The nations in the Mediterranean are ready to receive extensive autonomy in preparation for full independence. This is likely to result in an influx of immigrants desiring to obtain British nationality before independence is formalised."
 ENG_self_government_for_africa_desc:1 "The nations in Africa are ready to receive extensive autonomy in preparation for full independence. This is likely to result in an influx of immigrants desiring to obtain British nationality before independence is formalised."

 ENG_decolonized:1 "Britain has decolonised"
 ENG_global_defense:1 "Global Defence"
 ENG_maintaining_imperial_integrity_desc:1 "The defence of our Empire begins with mastery of the seas and the loyalty of our Dominions. Other naval powers must be warned to not threaten our naval superiority, and at the same time we must exert increasing control over our subjects so that we are strong across the globe."
 ENG_alliance_with_germany_desc:1 "Our interests are aligned with the Germans - while they desire hegemony of the European continent, we desire a Europe that will not threaten the British Isles while we see to our global Empire. Perhaps an alliance, as per the King's wishes, would not be all that strange a co-operation."
 ENG_organize_the_blackshirts:1 "Organise the Blackshirts"

 ENG_the_british_path_to_fascism_desc:1 "Our path to fascism will be our own, and we will not bend the knee to those on the continent who consider themselves our ideological superiors. The people remember the last war, and any co-operation with the regime existing in [GER.GetName] would be sure to incur their wrath."
 ENG_concessions_to_the_trade_unions_desc:1 "Our efforts to re-arm are continuously marred by conflicts with the trade unions. We may well have a much smoother transition if we elect to co-operate with them, rather than continue to struggle against them."
 ENG_concessions_to_the_trade_unions_tt_2:1 "§RIf Decolonisation has not been achieved within 2 years of becoming Communist, a civil war will start!§!\n"
 ENG_the_british_communist_alternative_desc:1 "Rather than side with Moscow, we will start our own co-operation of communist states. The British are second to none on the world scene, and we will not bow to Moscow, not now, nor ever."
 ENG_enforce_decolonization:1 "Enforce Decolonisation"
 ENG_enforce_decolonization_desc:1 "Just as we have decolonised, so too must the other nations of the world. We will issue an ultimatum, and those who do not see the wisdom of our words will be made to see that wisdom, instead."
 ENG_soviet_cooperation:1 "Soviet Co-operation"
 ENG_soviet_cooperation_desc:1 "Though we have our differences, we also share an enemy. We shall propose an attack from both sides, squashing the Germans before they realise what has happened."
 ENG_the_one_true_revolution_desc:1 "No co-operation will ever be possible with Moscow. Corruption is rife in [SOV.GetNameDef], and the only hope is to cut out its heart and assume undisputed global leadership of the Worker's Cause."
 ENG_socialist_science_pool_desc:1 "We must co-ordinate an exchange of technological knowledge so that all our allies may benefit from our advances, and so that we may benefit from theirs. This is the only way that the worker's struggle will succeed."
 ENG_british_commonwealth_air_training_plan_desc:0 "Our military success hinges upon our mastery of the air, and therefore the skill of our air crews. We will embark upon the largest aviation training programme the world has ever seen to ensure we have all the trained pilots and crews we require to master this new dimension of warfare."
 ENG_imperial_conference_defense_dominion:0 "Imperial Conference Defence Agreements"
 HOL_open_second_paranam_bauxite_mine_desc:0 "Bauxite from Suriname is of tremendous importance to the production of aluminium for the major powers' aeroplane industries. With the current military build-up around the world the demand for aluminium has increased dramatically, and we could therefore undoubtedly increase our exports if we were to open a second bauxite mine in Paranam."
 HOL_antilles_defenses:0 "Antilles Defences"
 HOL_antilles_defenses_desc:0 "Considering the huge importance of our oil refineries on Aruba and Curaçao, it is not strange that foreign parties with a vested interest in them seem very nervous about the weak state of our defences here. If we want to avoid these parties feeling the need to defend the islands for us, perhaps we should see to improving the defences ourselves..."
 HOL_the_crown_jewel_colony_desc:0 "As India is to the British, so are the East Indies to us. However, the current, out-dated infrastructure in the East Indies simply will not do in this modern age. Our National Pride must be treated as such, and so the infrastructure shall be modernised to bring it more in line with what is expected of such an important part of our nation."
 HOL_reinforce_java_desc:0 "Java houses the largest part of the East Indian archipelago's population and industry, as well as its capital and all the major military bases and headquarters. Consequently, it is by far the most important island of the East Indies, and we should improve its defences to ensure we can remain in control of it even if all else is lost."
 HOL_the_foundations_of_defense:0 "The "Foundations of Defence""
 HOL_the_foundations_of_defense_desc:0 "The "Defensiegrondslagen van Nederlands-Indië" was a report drafted in 1927, analysing the defensibility of our colonies. With the recent increase in Japanese aggression, and knowing full well their designs on the East Indies, perhaps this document should be dusted off, and the defensive weak points it identifies prioritised for the allocation of our newly freed-up resources."
 HOL_sumatra_desc:0 "Though the largest contiguous landmass entirely part of the East Indies, Sumatra, Java's northern neighbour, has fallen well behind in industrialisation and infrastructure. We should remedy this at once."
 HOL_continue_the_war_in_batavia_desc:1 "The invasion we feared has come to pass, and our defences have been swept aside. The government has managed to escape and is now in exile, hosted by our allies. Though our Queen would rather that the government remain in exile and 'close to the action' in Europe, we think the time has come to relocate to the East Indies, and from there continue the war as a sovereign power."
 HOL_expand_the_colonial_army_desc:0 "One thing the East Indies do not lack is manpower. By whichever concessions and promises we are required to make, we must make service in the army more attractive, while also making it clear that new colonial recruits are the only defence the islands have against the greed of the Japanese."
 HOL_abandon_the_gold_standard_desc:0 "Refusing to drop the Gold Standard has cost us tremendous resources these past years. Now that France has left the Gold Bloc, only the Swiss and ourselves remain. The time has come to allow the devaluation of the Guilder, and to use the freed-up resources to improve the sorry state of our defences."
 HOL_expand_the_artillerieinrichtingen_desc:0 "The Artillerie-Inrichtingen manufactures munitions and a small number of small arms (under licence) for our forces. It should be expanded if we aim to increase our military."
 HOL_daf_desc:1 "Our domestic car industry is not non-existent, and could well be contracted to produce military vehicles. With some state assistance, Van Doorne's Aanhangwagen Fabriek (DAF), could well become able to provide our military with all the motorised and mechanised equipment it might need."
 HOL_domestic_innovation_desc:0 "The rapid industrialisation of our nation has opened up new opportunities in R&D that we should pursue."
 HOL_prepare_the_inundation_lines_desc:0 "Ever since our independence war against the Spanish in the 16th century, inundation, or intentional flooding of the land, has been an integral part of our defences. Properly prepared, it will surely save us again: we have yet to see a tank that can cross water."
 HOL_further_reinforce_the_ports_desc:0 "We should further strengthen our coastal defences, to discourage any British notion of "lending us their assistance" without our express permission."
 HOL_southward_defenses:0 "Southward Defences"
 HOL_southward_defenses_desc:0 "We must establish a defensive line along the Meuse river, to thwart any northward push through Belgium. A further, final strengthening of our coastal defences should definitively smash any potential British plans to land an expeditionary force in our harbours."
 HOL_germany_is_the_greater_threat_desc:0 "In light of Germany's increasing aggression, we should direct our defences eastward, just in case they are less respectful of our neutrality than they were in the last war..."
 HOL_fortress_holland_desc:0 "We must bet everything on Fortress Holland. The area north of the great rivers and west of the IJsselmeer encompasses by far the larger part of our population and industry. Sacrificing the rest of the country might allow us to hold out long enough in our industrialised area for a more powerful ally to come to our aid in time."
 HOL_modernize_the_grebbeline:1 "Modernise the Grebbe Line"
 HOL_modernize_the_grebbeline_desc:0 "The southern front of Fortress Holland is well-defended by the great rivers the Rhine and the Meuse. This leaves only a gap to the east of Amsterdam, between the IJsselmeer to the north and the Rhine to the south. The defensive line located here, the Grebbe Line, must be modernised and reinforced if it is to hold against determined assault."

 HOL_expand_the_amsterdam_petroleum_harbor_desc:0 "An increase in the size of our navy requires a comparable increase in the size of our fuel stores, lest we are left with ships that we cannot afford to use.

With German good-will they might provide us with the plans for the German battlecruiser Scharnhorst, allowing us to use these as a basis from which to create our own designs. These ships would surely deter any attack on our colonies."
 HOL_volk_en_vaderland_desc:0 "Our decision to favour one neighbour over the other means that we have definitively abandoned our neutrality.

As such, the colour orange has become a national symbol, reflected both in the custom of adding an orange pennant to the flag on days of national celebration, as well as short patriotic songs such as 'Oranje Boven', or 'Orange Above', celebrating the Queen and the royal family as a whole."
 HOL_de_vernieuwing_desc:0 "As part of the Queen's programme, the 'vernieuwing' or 'renewal' will do away with the flawed concept of political parties.

 HOL_zandery_military_airport_desc:0 "Due to the importance of Surinamese bauxite and Curaçao oil to the Allied war effort, the Americans have proposed to aid in their defence by establishing a radar post on Curaçao, and building an airport and infrastructure at Zandery in Suriname. Once finished, it should be the largest military airport in South America."
 HOL_form_the_benelux_desc:0 "We, the small nations of Western Europe, squashed for centuries between the power-houses of Britain, France, and now Germany, have had enough of the conflicts tearing our continent apart.
