 gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Tanks in World War I were developed separately and simultaneously by the United Kingdom and France as a means to break the deadlock of trench warfare on the Western Front. The name Tank was adopted by the British during the early stages of their development, as a security measure to conceal their purpose. Early tanks were armed with machineguns and small cannons, moved slowly, and were armoured only enough to stop small arms fire."
 GER_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "The Leichttraktor was a German experimental tank. After the first world war, Germany was restricted in military development by the Versailles Treaty but a secret programme under the name cover 'Traktor' was developing armoured military vehicles and artillery."

 GER_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s. Design of the Panzer I began in 1932 and mass production began in 1934. Intended only as a training tank to introduce the concept of armoured warfare to the German Army, the PzKpfw I was used extensively in combat due to a lack of more modern tanks."

 GER_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The VK1602 Leopard was a planned German reconnaissance vehicle designed in 1942. It was planned to arm the vehicle with the 75mm Kwk 41, although that was changed to a smaller 50mm cannon. The VK 1602 had sloped frontal armour, influenced by the Panther medium tank. In order to increase cross-country performance, the VK 1602 was fitted with 350mm wide tracks."
 GER_light_tank_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Towed guns which were assigned to the infantry gun companies of motorised infantry regiments had difficulties keeping up with tanks during combat. The easiest solution was to modify a spare tank chassis to carry it into battle. In the case of the Bison, it uses the chassis of the Panzer I."
 GER_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "As early as 1934/35, General Heinz Guderian envisioned two basic types to act as the most numerous equipment for the future German Panzer Divisions. The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger calibre gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."
 GER_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tank-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tank of the Second World War, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."
 GER_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Sturmgeschütz III assault gun was Germany's most produced armoured fighting vehicle during World War II. It was built on the chassis of the proven Panzer III tank. Initially intended as a mobile, armoured light gun for infantry support, the StuG was continually modified and was widely employed as a tank destroyer."
 GER_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Jagdpanther (German: 'hunting panther') was a tank destroyer built by Nazi Germany during World War II based on the chassis of the Panther tank. It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western fronts. The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armour and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of Germany in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew training."

 GER_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Tiger I was a German heavy tank developed in 1942 as an answer to the unexpectedly impressive Soviet armour encountered in the initial months of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, particularly the T-34 and the KV-1."

 GER_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Known under the informal name Königstiger but, often semi-literally translated as the King Tiger by Allied soldiers, the design followed the same concept as the Tiger I, but was intended to be even more formidable. The Tiger II combined the thick armour of the Tiger I with the sloped armour used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, was protected by 100 to 180mm of armour to the front and was armed with the long barreled 8.8 cm Kampfwagenkanone 43 L/71 gun."
 GER_heavy_tank_destroyer_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Elefant (Elephant) was a heavy tank destroyer based on the chassis of the cancelled Porsche Tiger Project and fitted with an 88 mm Panzerabwehrkanone 43/2 gun."

 GER_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Entwicklung series was a late-War attempt by Germany to produce a standardised series of tank designs. There were to be standard designs in six different weight classes.
