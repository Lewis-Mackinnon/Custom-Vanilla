 lar_congress_of_paris.5.desc:1 "While the other delegations in Paris have been arguing about who should get territories none of their countries actually control, our diplomats have been pushing for a more achievable goal. The French government has indicated that it is favourably disposed to our proposal to ceede Morrocco to us in return for our promise to support them in any upcoming war. This would connect our holdings in North and West Africa."
 lar_france_political_violence.2.desc:1 "A coalition of labour unions and intellectuals has called for a 'Day of Action' in the capital in response to recent political decisions. Despite the efforts of the police to keep the demonstrations contained, small groups of anarchists and communist radicals attempted to instigate a riot. Multiple shops were ransacked and trams were overturned. Attempts by the rioters to build barricades in the Rue Royale to block access to the National Assembly were disrupted by mounted police.\n\nAs the rioters dispersed across France and the workers return to their workbenches, many in the country wonder if the government is still capable of maintaining law and order."
 lar_france_political_violence.3.desc:1 "Following a recent government decision, monarchists and right-wing extremists from across the country have descended upon the capital with the express purpose to 'finish the work left undone in 1934', when a similar riot had failed to storm parliament but had managed to force the government to resign.\n\nAlthough the police was forewarned that the protests would likely turn violent, they were unprepared for the level of organisation and aggression displayed by these well-prepared groups. In several instances, police guarding the Place de la Concorde were forced to open fire on the protestors to hold their position.\n\nWith several dozen dead and hundreds of wounded, the protestors have withdrawn from the capital to lick their wounds, but they have succeeded in showing the country that the government is not safe even in its own capital."
 lar_france_french_union.3.desc:1 "Despite all efforts by the local governments, the voters in Algeria, Morroco and Tunesia have overwhelmingly rejected the proposed French Union. Immediately following the announcement of the results, large demonstrations took place in several major cities across the area as nationalist groups capitalised on their victory to demand the immediate and full independence of their countries.\n\nThe Commander of French Forces in North Africa has sent an urgent request for reinforcements as it appears likely that some more radical elements might attempt to take matters into their own hands."
 lar_france_french_union.5.desc:1 "After an intense and sometimes tumultuous campaign, it appears that the nationalist side has won the referendum on membership in the French Union in most areas of French West Africa. While the local Europeans are still trying to digest the result, leaders of local independence movements have clamoured for action and proclaimed the result as a clear mandate for full independence."
 lar_france_french_union.11.desc:1 "The referendum results coming in from Indochina paint a grimmer picture than expected. While few in the capital believed that the nationalist hotbeds would vote to join the union, it appears that nationalist sentiments are far wider spread than previously believed. In the event, no part of the territory returned a majority to join the union. Nationalist activists are already clamouring for immediate seccession from France, even at the cost of war, believing that this is the moment to gain their national independence."
 FRA_syria_intervention.3.desc:1 "The allied advance into Syria has stalled and Vichy forces have managed to consolidate a defensive line. Despite multiple, well co-ordinated attacks, the allied forces in the area have been unable to dislodge the defenders. Both sides have dug in and a cease-fire has been agreed upon, with Vichy still holding control over all relevant parts of the area."
 FRA_indochina_intervention.1.desc:1 "Allied assault columns have reached several major cities in Indochina, prompting the local governor to ask for a cease-fire. With the defenders scattered and poorly co-ordinated, any further resistance was deemed futile. The remaining defenders have surrendered their weapons and await repatriation to Vichy France."
 FRA_west_africa_intervention.2.a:1 "Fortune did not favour the bold."
 FRA_west_africa_intervention.3.desc:1 "Aware of their precarious supply situation and lack of reinforcements, Vichy and allied forces have conducted a long-running series of manoeuvres and counter-manoeuvres to try and bait each other into committing to a decisive battle on unfavourable terms. With men and material worn out, and no decision in sight, both sides have dug in and are awaiting the other's first move."
 lar_intervention_in_greece.1.desc:1 "The French ambassador has handed over a note from his government, pointing out our shared interests in the Eastern Mediterranean. The government of [From.GetLeader] appears particularly interested in acquiring the island of Crete as a naval base, but also notes that the existence of an 'unfriendly or hostile' government in Greece would make operations in the area much more difficult. As such, the [From.GetAdjective] government wants to sound us out for a possible joint intervention in Greece to install a more favourable government or to take over administration of the territories ourselves."

 lar_align_belgium.2.desc:1 "The [From.GetAdjective] cabinet has voted unanimously to accept our proposal, even though several members resigned rather than vote for it. A military liaison unit and a small group of civil servants have already made their way to Brussels to co-ordinate with the [From.GetAdjective] authorities."
 lar_concessions_to_italy.5.desc:1 "The [From.GetAdjective] ambassador has handed over a note from his government. It appears that [From.GetLeader] wants to formally ratify the preliminary agreements reached in Stresa. To sweeten the deal, the [From.GetAdjective] offers us the French territory in East Africa in case we agree.\n\nRumours circulate in diplomatic circles that the [From.GetAdjective] had previously approached the [ENG.GetAdjective] to issue a joint declaration with even bigger territorial concessions, but were rebuffed."
 lar_ratify_the_stresa_front.1.desc:1 "Preparations are underway for the signing and ratification of the Stresa Accords, formalising an alliance with France in return for territorial concessions. After months of work by the diplomatic service, the only thing left is to put ink to paper."
 lar_ratify_the_stresa_front.3.desc:1 "In a sudden reversal, the [From.GetAdjective] government has decided to no longer honour their previous commitment to ratif the Stresa Accords. All attempts to get an explanation through diplomatic channels have failed, with [From.GetAdjective] diplomats seeming equally shocked by the sudden change of heart."

 lar_end_the_occupation.3.desc:1 "Despite the generous offer to stand side by side against the Bolshevist threat and to pursue the war-mongers that started this war, [From.GetLeader] has rudely rebuffed our diplomatic advance. The French people, he declared, had failed to show any kind of martial prowess in the war thus far and he saw no reason to entrust the defence of [From.GetNameDef]'s western borders to a country that had already been defeated once."
 lar_low_stability_civil_war.1.desc:1 "After weeks of agitation and clandestine preparations, mass-strikes have broken out in several French cities. Almost immediately, armed so-called 'Worker's Defence Brigades' have formed, in some cases supported by mutineous army units. Forces loyal to the government were fired upon on numerous occassions across the country, with skirmishes between revolters and loyalists turning into pitched firefights.\n\nWith internal order steadily decreasing, the government has effectively lost control over wide swaths of the country."
 lar_arms_purchases.1.desc:1 "Noting the quickly deteriorating situation in Europe, French officials have reached out to us to acquire export licences for heavy weapons and modern aircraft, with orders to be placed in our factories as soon as these licenses are granted. While the overall volume of orders is too low to make a marked difference in the economy, it will still create quite a few jobs."
 lar_france_volunteers.3.desc:2 "With the end of the fighting in Spain, some of the people who went to fight for [From.GetLeader] have returned. Military intelligence wants to interview them to see if any of their experiences offer some insight into modern warfare, but many in the government worry that they might go on to radicalise other political groups."
 lar_non_intervention.2.desc:1 "Calling it a vital step in ending the violence in Spain, [From.GetnameDef] has formally signed on to the Non-Intervention Commitee. Whether or not they actually honour its terms remains to be seen."
 lar_appeal_to_overseas_territories.3.desc:0 "The governor of Indochina has declared his support for [This.GetLeader], noting that the government in Vichy is not constitutionally legitimised and clearly acting under duress. The military forces in the area, however, have largely remained loyal to the Vichy government, with an arrangement currently being negotiated to see them repatriated."
 lar_spain.9.desc:1 "The increasing independence with which the Anarchist communes have conducted themselves has come to a head with recent developments. Frustrated by our entirely reasonable efforts to maintain centralised control over key parts of our shared war effort, Anarchists and their POUM allies have escalated local disagreements into full-fledged street fighting with our forces.\n\nDespite its localised beginnings, the in-fighting has now spread further, threatening to jeopardise the integrity of our frontlines with the Nationalists."
 lar_spain.9.desc_2:0 "The increasing independence with which the Anarchist communes have conducted themselves has come to a head with recent developments. Frustrated by our entirely reasonable efforts to begin a gradual return to a stable and centralised government, Anarchists and their POUM allies have escalated local disagreements into full-fledged street fighting with our forces.\n\nThey would risk our hard-won victory over the Nationalists to uphold their silly notions of independence!"
 lar_spain.12.desc:1 "Falangist forces have surrendered en masse following the capture of their last major stronghold, and despite continued isolated resistance this marks the end of the organised military of the Falange. Though the conflict is greatly simplified as a result, our fight continues against our remaining enemies."
 lar_spain.14.desc:1 "Anarchist resistance, though fierce, has become increasingly disorganised in recent weeks. Today's military victory has finally prompted an unconditional surrender from the Defence Council, though isolated fighting continues where individual communes refuse to acknowledge the order. Though the conflict is greatly simplified as a result, our fight continues against our remaining enemies."
 lar_spain.15.desc:1 "POUM resistance, though fierce, has become increasingly disorganised in recent weeks. Today's military victory has finally prompted an unconditional surrender from the communist leadership, upon which our forces have begun entering their now-uncontested strongholds. Though the conflict is greatly simplified as a result, our fight continues against our remaining enemies."

 lar_spain.30.desc:0 "Seeing as how our co-operation has been steadily increasing, the [From.GetAdjective] government has now come with a proposal for a fully-fledged alliance, which, aside from ourselves and the Spanish, might also include the Italians and the French."

 lar_spain.54.desc:1 "We have been informed by our diplomats in [From.GetNameDef] that the [From.GetAdjective] government has seized our gold reserves! Allegedly they do not even deem an official communique to be necessary, stating that this is a 'matter of course' to obtain 'overdue payment' for their materiel assistance."
 lar_spain.63.desc:0 "As expected, with some well-placed materiel support the Communist groups that have troubled the [From.GetAdjective] government for some time have now been emboldened into action. A large-scale uprising seeks to take control over the government, but relies heavily upon our support. Its leaders, while idealistic and eager, have little experience in the waging of a civil war, and have now turned to us for leadership and aid."
 lar_spain.64.desc:0 "Though the political situation in [From.GetNameDef] has long been unstable, it appears that the severity of the conflict has taken the [From.GetAdjective] government by surprise. They have requested any aid we can muster to help them in their fight against Fascism, and urge us to not dally too long in this critical time.\n\nIt is doubtful whether the Republican government can win the current civil war without outside assistance, and, though the victory of a democratic Spain would be a desirable outcome, it is likely that providing this aid would encourage Communist sympathisers in our own country."

 lar_spain.77.desc1:0 "Having lived in exile ever since the proclamation of the Second Republic in 1931, the last King to rule Spain, Alfonso XIII, has died in Rome earlier today. Succumbing to heart problems at a relatively early age, due to the status of his exile and the current situation in [Root.GetNameDef] it is expected that he will be buried in Rome itself.\n\nWhile Alfonso's first and second sons have renounced their rights to the throne already in 1933, and so it would seem his third son, Infante Juan, would be heir, there are rumours that the late King's second son, Infante Jaime, is considering re-affirming his succession right."
 lar_spain.79.desc:0 "Accompanied by much pomp and celebration, today saw the coronation of King [Root.GetLeader] in the Cathedral of Reims. After the official ceremony, the King greeted the jubilant crowds awaiting outside, ecstatic to see the return of their nation to the status of a monarchy.\n\nIn a speech directed to his subjects, the King stressed the unity of the French and Spanish countries, symbolised in his person. Wherever in the world a Frenchman's interests are threatened, they will find a Spaniard at their side to champion their cause."
 lar_spain.83.desc:0 "Over the past few weeks our liaisons, representatives, and loyal Stalinist ministers and officers in [SPD.GetNameDef] have repeatedly been withheld important information and denied access to [SPD.GetAdjective] government and military officials. Word has now reached us that our men are being systematically removed from positions of influence, and that even our foreign aid programmes are being stonewalled.\n\n"Coincidences" of this frequency cannot be pure chance. The [SPD.GetAdjective] government is displaying clear signs of treachery and a desire to renege on its obligations to [SOV.GetNameDef], and voices in Moscow beginning to call for punitive action and a tightening of the reins."
 lar_spain.90.desc:0 "The power struggle between the various parties of the Left, so recently united in victory in the 1936 elections, has already come to a head. Wary of President Niceto Alcalá-Zamora's centrist and compromising policies, his alienated supporters in the Cortes judged the very dissolution of the Cortes that resulted in the elections to be unconstitutional, and dismissed him from office.\n\nIn Alcalá-Zamora's stead, the Cortes has elected his old rival, Manuel Azaña, who now has inherited the unenviable task of bringing back stability to the increasingly-polarising Spanish political scene."
 lar_bruneval_raid.1.desc:0 "Reports about an enemy raid have arrived, indicating that a small enemy force attacked one of our radar installations. Following a spritied, but ultimately unsuccessful, defence by the garrison the enemy force took control of the installation for a short period of time before an immediate, vigirously executed counter-attack drove them back to the beach, where they hastily boarded landingcraft and departed.\n\nA thorough inspection of the radar installation revealed that a number of components had been removed, and a roll count revealed that one of the radar technicians was absent, possibly having been abducted by the enemy raiders."
 lar_capture_tito.1.desc:0 "Our operation to capture or kill the Yugoslav partisan leader Tito has not been met with success. The first wave of airbourne troops came down close enough to the cave where we suspected Tito to be hiding, but were met with murderous fire from strong enemy units that our intelligence had missed. While our troops fought bravely, enemy reinforcements arrived sooner than expected. Even a desperate breakout attempt was not successful. \n\nThe survivors have withdrawn to friendly lines. Tito's current whereabouts are unknown."
 lar_rescue_mussolini.2.desc:0 "The mission to liberate Mussolini has been successful. The small unit of paratroopers successfully landed near the hotel and stormed the building without any shots being fired. The local guards stood down after realising the hopelessness of resistance. Mussolini was subsequently flown out on a Fiesler Storch and returned to friendly lines, from where he will travel to meet [GER.GetLeader]."
 lar_operative_event.5.desc:0 "Our counter-intelligence service has achieved a major success: following extensive interrogation, and upon being informed of [This.GetHerHis] likely fate if [This.GetSheHe] was charged with espionage, the captured [From.From.GetAdjective] agent [This.GetName] has agreed to co-operate with us in return for a full amnesty of [This.GetHerHis] crimes against the state.\n\nWith [This.GetHerHis] in-depth knowledge of the inner workings of the [From.From.GetAdjective] intelligence services, [This.GetSheHe] will no doubt find it much easier to infiltrate [From.From.GetNameDef] and remain undetected by [From.From.GetAdjective] counter-intelligence."
 occupied_countries.1.desc:1 "After a long and concerted effort to improve co-operation and compliance between our occupation forces and local civilian authorities, we are now ready to put control of [From.From.GetNameDef] back into the hands of a local government. This new government is made up of sympathetic civilians and is ready to closely co-ordinate with us."
 lar_news.1.desc_franco:0 "After a long and grueling civil war, the Nationalists, united under Francisco Franco, have finally defeated their Republican enemies and secured full control over Spain. Though isolated pockets of Republican troops continue to wage a guerrilla war that may well hamper the exertion of local Nationalist control in previously Republican areas, it is unlikely further co-ordinated resistance of any significance will materialise.\n\nAs the nation focusses on rebuilding its warn-torn cities and industry, it remains to be seen what effects the Nationalists' ideological amalgamation will have on their foreign policy, and whether the generous foreign military aid they received will be repaid."
 lar_news.1.desc_franco_unified:0 "Recent weeks have seen tensions rise between the various factions among the victorious Nationalists, but now, with the banishment of recalcitrant leaders and the forceful unification of political parties, Francisco Franco appears to have been able to mend these divides, and thereby unify the remaining factions behind his cause. Though isolated pockets of Republican troops continue to wage a guerrilla war, the Civil War can finally be considered well and truly over.\n\nAs the nation focusses on rebuilding its warn-torn cities and industry, it remains to be seen what effects the Nationalists' ideological amalgamation will have on their foreign policy, and whether the generous foreign military aid they received will be repaid."

Though isolated pockets of Republican troops continue to wage a guerrilla war that may well hamper the exertion of local Carlist control in previously Republican areas, it is unlikely further co-ordinated resistance of any significance will materialise.\n\nThe bravery and fanaticism of the Carlist Requetés were key in securing their victory, and this same high morale characterises the Spanish post-war rebuilding efforts. With the war over, however, many Carlists impatiently await when their efforts are rewarded and the rightful Carlist claimant will at last ascend the Spanish throne."

Though isolated pockets of Nationalist troops continue to wage a guerrilla war that may well hamper the exertion of local Republican control in previously Nationalist areas, it is unlikely further co-ordinated resistance of any significance will materialise.\n\nAgainst all the odds, and relying on minimal Soviet aid, the Spanish Republic was able to maintain its democratic integrity while beleaguered both by internal and external enemies.

To the contrary, the communes have reportedly succeeded in stabilising and rebuilt the region, and continue to attract like-minded immigrants from nations across the world.\n\nIn light of continued international hostility the communes have however elected to stay organised under their "defence council", and continue on a course of extensive armament programmes."
 lar_news.24.desc:0 "[POR.GetAdjective] and [?global.POR_iberian_summit_spanish_tag.GetAdjective] politicians have been working together, appealing to the [GER.GetAdjective] government and seeking to be admitted into the [GER.GetFactionName]. If this is an opportunistic manoeuvre to acquire new territories or if it is just a desperate attempt to avoid occupation, it is yet unclear. \n\nHowever, after assessing the situation, [GER.GetNameDefCap] decided that this would be beneficial for their interests and finally allowed the Iberian nations to join the alliance."

The Emperor has thanked his subjects for their loyalty and has stated that he will rule in the behalf of all the citizens living under his rule."

Though Nationalist leadership has already seized upon this and declared the end of the Civil War, experts point at the ever-growing dissent within the Nationalist faction itself and argue it may simply be moving into a new stage. With the loss of a common enemy they deem it only too likely that these disagreements will further fracture the unity of the Nationalists.\n\nTo some extent Nationalist leaders and the people themselves seem to see this too, as militias formed during the Civil War to defeat the Republicans have not yet been disbanded, and instead maintain a vigilant eye on their neighbours."

Now, [From.GetOldAdjective] forces have advanced deep into southern Iberia and have begun establishing Moorish settlements in the region for the first time in centuries. [From.GetOldNameDefCap] has as such been reorganised into a new nation known as “[From.GetNameDefCap]”, reclaiming the legacy of the ancient Sultanate which once ruled all of Iberia.\n\nThe ancient Umayyad Caliphate governed almost the entirety of the Islamic world; from Iberia in the West to Persia in the East. Perhaps [From.GetLeader] desires to emulate this old Empire and reunite the disparate peoples of the Middle-East, North Africa, and Europe."
