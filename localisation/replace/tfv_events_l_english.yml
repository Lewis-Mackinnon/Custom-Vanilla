 tfv_australia.1.d:0 "The Singapore Strategy has been the cornerstone of our deterrence policy against [JAP.GetNameDef] since the end of the Great War. However, the redeployment of the Main Fleet to Singapore in case of attack is reliant on support from our allies in [From.GetNameDef]. With the potential threat against British holdings in the Far East increasing by the day, the [From.GetAdjective] high command has presented a potential new stratagem, that would see Australia in far greater control of the defence of the region.\n\nIt's a sound plan, and the only question is whether we believe they can provide the security we require."
 tfv_australia.1.a:1 "Australia should provide the first line of defence in Southeast Asia."
 tfv_australia.11.d:0 "[Root.GetAdjective] troops stood ready to assume responsibilities for the protection of all [From.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia as soon as [From.GetLeader] approved the agreement.\n\nWhile some local resistance was met in the transfer, fear of foreign aggression ensures that most recognise the need for [Root.GetAdjective] defence."
 tfv_australia.12.d:0 "Believing themselves to be sufficiently capable of protecting [From.GetAdjective] territory in Southeast Asia, [From.GetNameDef] has refused our proposal of a shared defence strategy.\n\nUndoubtedly motivated by worries of colonial control, their actions are understandable. However, if they are incapable of protecting their territory - as we fear - we may see it used as the launch platform for an attack on the Australian continent."
 tfv_australia.20.d:0 "We have long worryingly followed the growth of nationalistic fervour in [From.GetNameDef], and it seems as though the day has finally come when it has spilled out past their own borders.\nCiting a common heritage as "pioneer nations," suggestions have been floated of a united state of Oceania. Rhetoric has turned increasingly aggressive in the face of [Root.GetAdjective] resistance, however.\n\nNow political speculation has turned to open hostility, and [From.GetLeader] publicly demands the annexation of all [Root.GetAdjective] territory to the state of [From.GetNameDef].\nIf we refuse, a forceful invasion seems entirely possible."
 tfv_australia.22.d:0 "Failing to acknowledge their precarious position in the geopolitical landscape of the Pacific, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer to make New Zealand one of the foremost provinces of [Root.GetNameDef].\nNot realising they are merely Britain's lapdog, [From.GetAdjective] Premier [From.GetLeader] cited principles of [From.GetAdjective] "freedom and independence."\n\nIt seems we have to remind [From.GetNameDef] exactly what we mean by describing their position as "geopolitically precarious.""
 tfv_australia.32.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Requests Political Co-operation"
 tfv_australia.32.d:0 "Following the formal departure of [From.GetNameDef] from the Commonwealth, the [From.GetAdjective] government is now looking for new allies. With Europe seemingly on the brink of a new, costly conflict, and the strategic value of [From.GetNameDef] to any potential conflict in the Pacific, a partnership may be in our best interest.\n\nIt would certainly emphasise Southeast Asia, the Far East and the Pacific as parts of our sphere of influence, and ensure that no matter what happens in Europe, [Root.GetAdjective] interests will not be intruded upon."
 tfv_australia.33.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Pacific Co-operation"
 tfv_australia.34.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declines Co-operation Project"
 tfv_australia.41.d:0 "With turmoil rampant in the former [HOL.GetAdjective] colonies, it is apparent that [INS.GetNameDef], our trusted neighbour, requires a helping hand to maintain their hard-won authority. For as long as they need our support, [Root.GetNameDef] is there to support the [INS.GetAdjective] government.\n\nOne day [INS.GetNameDef] will be able to stand up to European colonial forces as our Pacific brother. Until then, we will ensure they stand strong along with us."
 tfv_australia.62.d:0 "Having kept the [From.GetAdjective] people oppressed under their bourgeois thumbs, the fat cats in control of the government of [From.GetNameDef] have now announced that they under absolutely no conditions will co-operate with the [Root.GetAdjective] state.\nPity for them that we do not seek their co-operation, but rather that of those slaving under the weight of their opulent obesity!"
 tfv_australia.70.d:0 "Claiming that a failure on the part of [Root.GetNameDef] to defend its colonial holdings in Southeast Asia would have catastrophic implications for [From.GetNameDef] national defence, [From.GetLeader] has requested that the [From.GetAdjective] government be given full, independent responsibility for the defence of the region.\nWhile not an outright demand, the growth of [From.GetAdjective] strategic and military influence in the region has the argument make some sense. The counterbalance being the recent political distancing from us that [From.GetNameDef] has embraced.\nThis would be an agreement with a potential partner, not a subject, and would leave the colonies de facto out of our hands, should [From.GetNameDef] choose to make it so."
 tfv_australia.72.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declines "Defence Project""
 tfv_australia.95.desc:0 "There has been a marked increase in Nationalist agitation all across Indonesia in the recent weeks. Intelligence estimates of the number of Nationalist sympathisers have grown to alarming size. Of particular concern are reports that some Nationalist leaders are openly discussing an armed insurrection. Just yesterday, a naval vessel intercepted a suspicious fishing boat south of Java. Found on board were weapons and ammunition without official markings. Interrogation of the crew has yielded no results so far, but it appears that someone is trying to stir up trouble."
 tfv_canada.1.d:0 "With diplomatic interests across the North American continent aligning, and Europe in greater turmoil by the day, [From.GetNameDef] has proposed a radical political move.\nBy entering a mutual defence pact, we can ensure the safety and integrity of the Americas, while significantly expanding our political and military options in any given situation. [From.GetLeader] stated it was an "obvious choice," to ensure the prosperity of [Root.GetNameDef] as well as [From.GetNameDef], and [Root.GetLeader] seems to agree that it is difficult to argue otherwise."
 tfv_canada.2.d:0 "Today marks the signing of a new treaty, celebrating the friendship and support shared between [Root.GetNameDef] and [From.GetNameDef]. Our two countries promise to aid each other in matters of foreign policy, including the defence of our continent.\n\nWith our nations working together, the foreign aggressors of the world do not stand a chance against us."
 tfv_canada.3.d:0 "Despite the benefit of a formalised measure of military co-operation between our two countries, as exemplified by the Joint Defence Board, the [From.GetAdjective] has rejected our negotiations for a permanent alliance.\nThe pact would have ensured the integrity of the North American continent, but now it seems we will have to find other means of defending the homeland."
 tfv_canada.10.d:0 "Following its abandonment of the Commonwealth, [From.GetNameDef] is negotiating for a position as one of our allies in the [Root.GetFactionName]. Their Communist convictions are strong, and it's undeniable that an ally on the American continent would be of great benefit to the cause of the world revolution...\nWhile their concept of Patriotic Socialism, independent nature, and [From.GetLeader]'s attempted Industrialisation Miracle may all cause issues in the future, this seems too good of an opportunity to pass up."
 tfv_canada.21.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer of alliance, seeing clear benefit in a relationship with a strong American state.\nWith this diplomatic move we will be far more capable of projecting our power in North America, and it is no coincidence that the Berlin-Ottawa Axis runs sharp through London."
 tfv_canada.30.d:0 "As the Synarchists are growing in influence, their demands are growing in strength. It seems as though our government may no longer be able to keep their right-wing politics at bay, as clashes between Synarchists and government supporters have been reported across [Root.GetNameDef]. This includes the employment of lethal weapons on both sides.\nWhile it is unclear when and how the militarisation of the Synarchist party occurred, they pose a real and immediate threat to the current government.\n\nCivil war is at hand."
 tfv_canada.40.d:0 "While the strength of the recently reformed [Root.GetAdjective] state is undeniable, so are the realities of regional politics. Our old enemy, [USA.GetNameDef], dominates the continent, and have proven unable to keep themselves out of matters beyond their borders.\nThat makes the offer of co-operation with [From.GetNameDef] ever more valuable. Either of our countries might lack the force to prevent [USA.GetAdjective] intervention on our own, but against both north and south, [USA.GetLeader] will have to think twice before taking action.\n\nAnd perhaps they will be more amenable to the return of rightfully [Root.GetAdjective] territory..."
 tfv_canada.40.a:0 "We will squeeze the life out of our rotten state of a neighbour!"
 tfv_canada.41.d:0 "The [MEX.GetAdjective] government is in full accord regarding the threat posed to our countries by the aggressive policies of our southern neighbours. The only way we can survive is to break the stranglehold they have on the continent. We must strike soon, before they can finish re-arming. Certain territorial concessions will have to be made to our new friends, of course, but together, we will bring an end to the American hegemony!"
 tfv_canada.42.desc:0 "The [MEX.GetAdjective] government has declined our offer to work together against our common enemy. They seem to believe that they can simply ignore the rattlesnake poised to strike them, hoping that it will leave them alone so long as they don't make any threatening moves. It appears that we must look to our defences alone."
 tfv_canada.51.d:0 "Another attack has occurred on [Root.GetAdjective] soil, this time directly targetting one of our military factories!\nProduction has been stopped as reparations begin, but the culprits are still at large.\n\nAt least it has become clear that this is the work of a group, rather than a single individual."
 tfv_canada.52.d:0 "Law enforcement has been working with military police to make great strides in the case of continued factory sabotage. With the targetting of yet another factory, it has become apparent that the sabotage is not done by foreign spies, but rather by a group protesting the forced conscription introduced in Quebec!\n\nRegardless of their political concerns, our country is at war, and they are traitors of the highest degree."
 tfv_south_africa.1.d:0 "As we struggle with military coverage of the entire Empire, [From.GetNameDef] has approached us about an administrative agreement. Our colonies in Southern and Central Africa should be handed over to them, with full rights and responsibilities towards their defence."
 tfv_south_africa.4.d:0 "After long deliberation, the British government has come up with a compromise regarding the defence of the African colonies. Under this new scheme, the colonies will be responsible for their own defence but will enjoy greater freedom of managing their own affairs."
 tfv_south_africa.13.desc.b:0 "Citing a lack of available materiel, the [GER.GetAdjective] government has decided that it is no longer in their interest to send us further support. All efforts are instead focussed on building their own military. This leaves us in a difficult position."
 tfv_south_africa.15.desc.b:0 "After long discussions with our [GER.GetAdjective] friends, they have agreed to send us a batch of light tanks. Although few in number, they might well be what tips the balance decisively in our favour."
 tfv_south_africa.16.desc.b:0 "After long discussions with our [HOL.GetAdjective] friends, they have agreed to send us a batch of experimental light tanks. Although few in number, they might well be what tips the balance decisively in our favour."
 tfv_south_africa.30.b:0 "Every square metre of French soil is sacred. We will not yield!"
 tfv_south_africa.40.b:0 "Offering our secrets to them would compromise our national security."
 tfv_new_zealand.3.desc:0 "Our delegation had to endure a long lecture by the Chairman of the Comintern, explaining that a country as small as ours can not possibly be the kind of developed industrial nation that could produce a communist revolution. We are, apparently, something else. In any event, we can not be part of the Comintern."
 tfv_new_zealand.6.desc:0 "The [JAP.GetAdjective] government has not even bothered to give us an official response to our request. Rumour has it that it is actually considered a source of great hilarity in [JAP.GetAdjective] government circles."
 tfv_raj.1.b:0 "We need these for homeland defence!"
 tfv_raj.210.desc:0 "The local workers had just broken for lunch when a violent explosion rocked one of our factories. Significant damage was done to the building itself, and several workers were injured by flying glass. Thankfully, the machine tools seem to have remained mostly intact. Police and army units have constructed a perimeter while investigators pick through the rubble in a search for clues to the cause of the explosion.\n\nRumours abound that it was the work of a resitance cell from the Quit India movement, turning their protest to violence in their struggle for freedom."
 tfv_raj.211.desc:0 "Just weeks after the first explosion, a second factory was suddenly destroyed, again just after the workers had left the main building for lunch. There can be little doubt that this is the work of an organised resistance group conducting a well-planned campaign of sabotage and terrorism. The brazen attacks in broad daylight show that the attackers appear to be very sure of themselves. "
 tfv_raj.212.desc:0 "A third explosion has devastated a factory in one of our states. This time, it appears the attacks got the timing wrong, as the bomb exploded halfway through the shift. Dozens of workers were killed and dozens more are still missing. Investigators are pursuing several leads, and a number of houses have already been searched. The results are deeply disturbing, ranging from Quit India propaganda to tools that could be used to create crude explosives. \n\nNone of those arrested seem to be the ringleaders, however, and they have so far refused to talk."
