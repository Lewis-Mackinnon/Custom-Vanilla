 MEX_church_power_3_desc:0 "We have ended attempts to stamp out the Catholic Church in Mexico. By allowing the priests a little autonomy, they will respect our control of the state and refrain from seeking to destabilise us."
 MEX_brown_water_navy_desc:0 "We have a coastal defence force capable of threatening submarine and surface raiders, but a dedicated enemy surface fleet would sweep us aside."

 MEX_politicised_army_desc:0 "The rulers of Mexico have been drawn from revolutionary army officers for almost three decades. The turbulent times we went through demanded firm leadership. The question is: has the turbulence passed, or is it becoming more severe? Should we professionalise the army or allow regional strongmen - caciques and caudillos - to carve out petty fiefdoms? Generals like Saturnino Cedillo in San Luis Potosí are raising private militias to protect their power. The many rebellions launched by dissatisfied officers in the past are likely to continue unless we act."

 MEX_strike_breaking_desc:0 "Industrial action is treasonous in a time of crisis. By controlling the labour in our strategic industries, we are able to increase output for the benefit of the Fatherland."
 MEX_proletarian_class_army_desc:1 "Only the Proletariat, armed and organised as a class army, will be able to defend and propagate the ideals of the Revolution."
 MEX_jose_gonzalo_escobar_desc:0 "General Escobar fought against the rebels of Pancho Villa during the turmoil and infighting of the Revolution, leading cavalry charges against the government's enemies. He ran afoul of President Calles and was exiled following his own rebellion attempt in 1929, but with the reorganisation of the cabinet, he can return."
 MEX_pablo_gonzalez_desc:0 "Pablo González is an army general with a talent for organising 'wet work'. He helped set up the ambush which killed the popular rebel and caudillo Emiliano Zapata in 1919."
 MEX_plutarco_calles_desc:0 "President between 1924 and 1928, Calles continues to exercise a great deal of power over the Mexican state thanks to his powerful network of patronage. He has been labelled the 'Jefe Máximo' (Great Leader) by his political enemies as a way of comparing him to dictator-for-life President Díaz. The term has entered mainstream use, although he insists he is simply a retired statesman giving advice for the benefit of the country."
 MEX_saturnino_cedillo_desc:0 "A wealthy Northern governor and military leader, General Cedillo exercises power thanks to a patronage system based upon personal loyalty. The waning influence of the caudillos and the centralisation of the country is a cause of great concern for him as it threatens his independence from the government."

 HOL_wilhelmina_desc:0 "For centuries the family of Orange-Nassau has been interwoven with the very history of the Netherlands itself. Like her forefather William the Silent in the Eighty Years' War, the current Queen, Wilhelmina, will undoubtedly prove an inspiration for Dutchmen rallying to the defence of their homeland, should their country ever be invaded."
 HOL_de_crisisjaren_desc:1 "Due to the peculiarities of global economics, the Great Depression has hit in the Netherlands much later than elsewhere. The Dutch decision to maintain the Gold Standard, while other nations abandoned it rather quickly, has further exacerbated the "crisis years" in the Netherlands tremendously. In keeping the Guilder from devaluing, no funds are left to aid the ailing Dutch economy, let alone improve the poor state of national defences.\n\nThe crisis can be reduced by investing in public works, and will become largely irrelevant if we capitulate and lose control of the crisis-stricken mainland."
 HOL_bernhard_organized_resistance:0 "Prince Bernhard Organised Resistance"
 ENG_joint_air_training_scheme_desc:0 "The British government has implemented a Commonwealth-wide training programme for its members' aircrews. We will be able to benefit heavily from this."
