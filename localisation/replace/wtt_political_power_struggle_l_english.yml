The leader of [From.GetNameDef] has noted that the population in his state are very concerned about the poor equipment of his soldiers. Many units do not even have a rifle for every man, and a number of soldiers have to use outdated weaponry including old muzzle-loaded muskets and swords. \n\nSince choosing sides in the ongoing conflict might lead to a military confrontation down the line, [From.GetLeader] wanted a firm commitment on our part to re-equip his forces with weapons before he will make his support publicly known."

In his reply, [From.GetLeader] noted that his military force is desperately lacking in experienced officers and is in dire need of reform. The people of [From.GetNameDef] would never tolerate him taking such a bold stance in the current struggle while his army was in such shambles. \n\nIf we were to help [From.GetLeader] in reforming his army, he would be happy to publically support us."
