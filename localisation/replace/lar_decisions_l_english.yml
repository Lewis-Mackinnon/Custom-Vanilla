 SPR_NATIONALISTS_INSTRUCTIONS:0 "It is imperative we do not dally too long, lest we give the Republicans time to prepare their defences."
 SPR_opposition_civil_war_preparations_desc:0 "While we labour to thwart their every move, our enemies are not idle. We would do well to keep their actions in mind as we make our preparations for the coming conflict."
 SPR_military_plot_republicans_desc:0 "Rumours have reached us of a sinister plot to overthrow the government, and despite our recent experiences with such coup attempts we are woefully unprepared to handle another one. We must thwart their plans wherever we can and delay them to give ourselves time to prepare."
 SPA_primo_de_rivera_speech_desc:0 "José Antonio Primo de Rivera is one of the founders of the Falange Española. A public speaker critical of democracy, perhaps he should be encouraged to hold further speeches to increase our popular support and further destabilise the nation."
 SPR_secure_leader_loyalty_desc:0 "Rumours have reached us that the loyalty of one of our previously-loyal military leaders is in question. We should ensure we regain their loyalty, even if the carrot we need to dangle before them can be rather expensive..."
 SPR_reassign_disloyal_leader_desc:0 "Rumours have reached us that the loyalties of certain of our military leaders are in question. We would do well to re-assign them to remote postings, to keep them from being easily able to continue plotting."
 SPA_reassign_disloyal_leader_mission_desc:0 "The government is becoming increasingly suspicious of some of our supporters in the military, and is now planning to reassign one of our key co-conspiritors to a remote posting, making it far harder for us to plan and co-operate."
 SPA_carlist_uprising_mission_desc:0 "Carlist elements in our faction have been resentful of our leadership and our increasing influence. Rather than fall in line, discontent is spreading throughout the Requetés, and rumours of insurrection are spreading. We should be ready to deal with a Carlist uprising, even as we deal with our Republican enemies."
 SPR_anarchist_uprising_mission_desc:0 "Our Anarchist 'allies' are continuing to conduct themselves with unwarranted expectations of independence and autonomy. The more we attempt to organise anarchist-held regions for the war effort, the more they whip up their people against the rightful Spanish government. We should be ready to deal with a full-blown Anarchist uprising, if this escalates further."
