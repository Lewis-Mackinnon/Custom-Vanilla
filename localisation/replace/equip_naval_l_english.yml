 ship_hull_submarine_3_desc:0 "The role of the submarine in the fleet outside of convoy attacks is still under debate. Achieving a balance between a combination of speed, range and weaponry will be key to the necessary model."
 light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Manoeuvrable light cruisers that can maintain a high speed will continue to be useful for scouting missions."
 light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Now skirting the limits of treaties, larger and more heavily armoured cruisers can be built, still with light enough weaponry to be classified as light cruisers."
 heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Washington Naval Treaty was set up to prevent an arms race in cruisers, among other ships, but this seems inevitable. By keeping armour light, the weapons load can be increased."
 heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Despite new efforts at treaties, refitting lighter cruisers with heavier weaponry remains efficient, although armour is still limited."
 heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "As restrictions are increasingly ignored worldwide, more balanced heavy cruiser designs with more priority on armour can be built. Better anti-air guns allow these ships to co-operate in naval air warfare."
 battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The post-war battlecruiser arms race resulted in several heavily armed designs, sacrificing armour for speed compared to battleships."
 battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Rebuilt and repurposed battlecruisers continue to outrun even modern battleship designs by lighter protection, but have developed better systems for fire control, detection and aerial defences."
 battleship_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armoured vessels ever built."
 battleship_3_desc:0 "Thicker armour, stronger engines, a battery of high-calibre guns and improved anti-air capabilities can allow battleships to remain relevant, if correctly employed, in a world where naval warfare is increasingly dominated by aerial support."
 ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armoured vessels ever built."

 carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe that naval aviation is the future. Converting old capital ships and ocean liners to carry aircraft will be the first step towards utilising these new doctrines."
 carrier_3_desc:0 "Improved construction methods and more specialised systems like deck edge elevators allow these carriers to transport more planes more efficiently."

 ship_hull_heavy_desc:0 "The ultimate symbol of naval power, these massive, heavily armoured behemoths still command respect on the high seas, even as some experts question their role in the age of the aeroplane and the submarine."
 ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff_desc:0 "In an attempt to do the impossible, German engineers succeeded in mating almost-battleship-level armament with a cruiser hull. The result is a ship that outguns any other known cruiser, but which is also expensive, comparatively slow and relatively poorly armoured."
 ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship:1 "Coastal Defence Ship"
 ENG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Programme as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 ENG_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programmes. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 ENG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Programme. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets. Use was eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 ENG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programmes. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 ENG_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasising gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 ENG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programmes. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 ENG_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armoured, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 ENG_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armoured but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 ENG_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorised in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armour belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Programme. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armour, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armour, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armour. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser."
 ENG_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and manoeuvrable, but had thinner armour and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 ENG_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal is a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armour would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 ENG_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-calibre cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller calibre, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 ENG_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Programme to replace the ageing Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armour and more powerful engines."
 ENG_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theatre. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Programme, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armour made the vessel fast and well protected."
 ENG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion is a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armour provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 ENG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armour plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 ENG_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armoured but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 ENG_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armoured and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 ENG_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armoured flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armour and AA weaponry provided a strong defence for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 ENG_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armour on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 FRA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardisation programme resulting of a centralised design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) rather than shipyard specific designs of the previous classes."
 FRA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorised in the 1939-40 naval programmes but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 FRA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval programme. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 FRA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers ware a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorised in the 1938 and 1939 naval programmes but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focussed more on an anti-aircraft role, and had an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons had larger engines."
 FRA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorised in the 1939-40 naval programmes but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 FRA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval programme. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armour."
 FRA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programmes, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 FRA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorised in the 1938 and 1939 naval programmes and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 FRA_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse is that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armour, and was slightly smaller."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy; very thin armour but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armour belt and underwater protection is considerably increased. Its AA armament is adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement is over 10,000 tons."
 FRA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval programme, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armour would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 FRA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armoured than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 FRA_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. Authorised in the 1931 and 1934 naval programmes, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armour and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 FRA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. Authorised in the 1910 and 1911 naval programmes, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armour and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernisations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 FRA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorised under the 1935 and 1938 naval programmes. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 FRA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval programme but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 FRA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorised in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improves upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armour plates, and larger engines."
 FRA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships is a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They feature a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armour. The entire design borrows elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 FRA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament is distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armour and strong engines provide the speed and defence needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 FRA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armour belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 FRA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorised in the 1938 naval programme, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armour, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 FRA_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would provide a good defence against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
 GER_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Blücher was the last armoured cruiser built by Germany. Her design was innovative for her time and paved the way for the later Von der Tann-class Battlecruisers. By World War I, she was already obsolete. Blücher was sunk at the Battle at the Doggerbank in 1915."
 GER_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (armoured Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 metres longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 GER_carrier_1_desc:0 "Designed in 1915, the Flugzeugdampfer I (Aeroplane Steamer I) Project was a conversion of the incomplete passenger liner Ausonia into an aircraft carrier. The construction was abandoned at the end of World War I. Had she been completed, she would have carried a mix of seaplanes and wheeled aircraft in her three hangars and would have displaced 12,500 tons."
 GER_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armour, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 GER_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs. With no limit on gun calibre or displacement, the H42 to H44 designs mounted increasingly heavier armament and armour protection, culminating in the 131,000 ton H44 design armed with eight 508mm (20") guns."
 ITA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Duca degli Abruzzi class was the fifth subclass of the Condottieri-class light cruisers. They were built before World War II to gain predominance in the Mediterranean Sea. They were the largest Italian light cruisers commissioned during the war, displacing over 9,400 tons. They were well-armoured and mount ten 152mm Ansaldo guns."
 ITA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Capitani Romani light cruisers were essentially designed to outrun and outgun the large new French destroyers of the late 1930s. Twelve hulls were ordered in late 1939, but only three were completed before the Italian armistice in 1943. They were lightly armoured and displaced only 3,700 tons, but were quite fast. They mount eight 135mm OTO/Ansaldo guns."
 ITA_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Francesco Caracciolo class was a class of capital ships was proposed just after WWI. The ships displaced about 34,000 tons, were well-armoured, and fairly fast for their size and vintage. Only one ship was launched, but it was cancelled in 1921."
 ITA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Impero battleships were a hypothetical class of late-war battleships. They displaced about 43,000 tons, were armed with 381mm Ansaldo guns, and were well-armoured."
 ITA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Falco is a hypothetical class of interwar Italian aircraft carriers They were comparable to the U.S. Yorktown class carriers and the British Ark Royal carrier. They displaced about 21,000 tons, had decent armour, and carried an average complement of aircraft."
 ITA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Sparviero was also a planned conversion of an ocean liner, the Augustus. The conversion began in late 1942, but did not get far. Germany scuttled the ship upon its capture after the Italian armistice. The carrier would have displaced 30,400 tons, been fairly well-armoured, and had a strong AA defence battery."
 ITA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Regina Margherita class is a hypothetical class of heavy battleships that would have been launched shortly before the start of the war. They would be comparable to the Japanese Yamato class battleships. They would be very well-armoured, displace about 60,000 tons, and be armed with 406mm guns."
 ITA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Regina Elena class is a hypothetical class of heavy battleships that would be launched around the time of Italy's entry into the war. They were comparable to the Montana class battleships planned by the U.S. They were highly armoured, displaced over 70,000 tons, and were armed with 406mm guns in their main battery."
 JAP_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Mogami class cruisers were heavily armed, equipped with good armour and strong engines that provided high speed. They were up-gunned from their original design and reclassified as heavy cruisers. The good AA defence and high speed ensured a long range of operations."
 JAP_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Agano-class light cruisers were designed primarily as flottila leaders for destroyer squadrons. They were fast, armed with 3 twin 152mm guns, but limited AA armaments and thin armour plates were major drawbacks of the design."
 JAP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Agatsuma class was light cruiser class that never saw any ships built before the end of the war. The cruisers were designed to be fast and heavily armed but light-armoured, to protect the fleets and carriers against enemy aircraft."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Furutaka-class and the following Aoba class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the Imperial Japanese Navy. They were designed the US Omaha and British Hawkins class as templates. Later in their life they were modernised and received new armaments and better engines."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The heavy Mogami class was an up-gunned and reclassified light cruiser class. This made them fast, heavily armed and well-armoured cruisers. Their long range came at the cost of, thinner armour protection."
 JAP_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Design B-65 battlecruisers were fast, moderately armoured vessels with good AA weaponry and modern armaments. Designed to fight the new heavy cruisers of the US Navy and to protect the fleet carriers of the IJN, the ships would have been a force to be reckoned with if finished."
 JAP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Fuso class battleships were built during WWI and modernised in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armoured and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centreline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry."
 JAP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Kongo battleships were built for the IJN just before World War I as battlecruisers, but were heavily modernised in the late 1930s and reclassified as first rate fast battleships. Their armour, guns and engines were all drastically upgraded and the Kongos emerged as the fastest Japanese battleships of the war."
 JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Tajima class was a hypothetical class of fast battleships, designed to be cheaper and faster to build than the massive Yamato class battleships. They utilised the older cannons of previous battleships, but high speed, adequate armour and AA provided the defence for these ships."
 JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Iwami class was a hypothetical class of battleships, that utilised new methods to speed up construction. They were well-armed with new cannons and heavy AA guns, and could match any similarly armed vessels for firepower. However, the resulting improvements meant a heavier and thus somewhat slower class of ships."
 JAP_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The hypothetical Super Yamato class saw the Yamato was used as a base, but the weapons would be even stronger with a main armament of 51cm cannons and a strong AA armament of the newest type. Their armour thickness was designed to withstand even shells from its own cannons, and they would displace around 70-80.000tons."
 JAP_carrier_1_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was Japan's first fleet carrier. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armoured carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."
 JAP_carrier_2_desc:0 "Soryu and Hiryu were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armoured. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations."
 JAP_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Taiho class aircraft carrier was the IJN's first fully armoured carriers, with an armoured flight deck to withstand multiple bomb and torpedo hits and still function effectively. A large air group together AND heavy AA armament would provide not just self-defence but also force projection over enemy forces."
 SOV_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class (Project 7) destroyers were authorised under the 1933-1938 shipbuilding programme. The class itself was heavily influenced by the Italian destroyer Maestrale and considered a successful design. Their displacement were in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they were well-armed and they had adequate AA and torpedo armament. Due to the powerful engines they were fast but short-ranged vessels."
 SOV_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasniy Krym class cruiser, originally the Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned into the Soviet Navy along with her half-sister Chervona Ukraina (ex Admiral Nakhimov). These vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Imperial Russian Navy. They were heavily armed and well-armoured cruisers for their time."
 SOV_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Komsomolets class light cruisers were series of hypothetical vessels. They were somewhat of a mix of older and new technologies. Using the incomplete hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer calibre guns and adequate AA armament they were suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities to the Kirov class cruisers."
 SOV_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Chapayev class (Project 68) cruisers were based on the Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers and authorised in the 1938-43 shipbuilding programme. As the first true light cruisers of the Soviet navy, they carried a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with an adequate torpedo armament. Overall, these were good ships with a thick armour belt, high speed, a good operational range, and a displacement of 10,500 to 14,000 tons. Due to the war and the invasion of the German forces, many ships of the class were cancelled and the rest were finished after the hostilities ended."
 SOV_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Sverdlov class cruisers (Project 68bis) were the last gun cruisers of the Soviet Navy and were improved versions of the preceding Chapayev class. Compared to the Chapayevs, they had the same main armament, machinery and armour protection, but had increased fuel capacity for greater range, improved underwater protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and slightly better seaworthiness. They were designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts. Due to the advent of the missile age, many ships were cancelled or not finished."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Kavkaz cruiser, originally the Admiral Nakhimov class light cruiser, was the half-sister of the Chervona Ukraina. Krasnyi Kavkaz was completed with a modified design that included larger-calibre 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because she was a rebuilt light cruiser, her armour was thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kirov class (Project 26) cruisers were the Soviet Navy's first modern cruisers. The design was based on the Italian Raimondo Montecuccoli class light cruisers and was built as part of the 1933-1938 shipbuilding programme. The ships displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They were armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provided good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armour belt was thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
 SOV_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Project 22 heavy cruisers were designed in the mid 1930's to counter similar vessels in neighbouring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They were equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defence, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks would be to scout for enemy forces and convoy hunting. The cost of the ships and the allocation of resources to other needs resulted in the cancellation of the project."
 SOV_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorised in 1914, just before WWI. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of WWI and the Russian Revolution doomed these ships from ever being finished."
 SOV_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Kronshtadt class (Project 69) battlecruisers were authorised in the 1938-43 shipbuilding programme and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on German Scharnhorst battlecruisers arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons. As hostilities broke out between Germany and the Soviet Union, the ships construction was halted and eventually cancelled. Alternative plans called for finishing the incomplete hulls as aircraft carriers under Project 69AV."
 SOV_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Marat class battleships (originally Gangut class) were WWI-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernised and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They had modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
 SOV_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 21 battleships were designed in the mid 1930's to be part of Stalin's Ocean-Going Navy. They would be very similar to the British Nelson-class battleships. The ships would displace around 41,000 tons, would be armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets (all forward), and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armour provided a strong defence against air and surface targets. The project was eventually cancelled but part of its elements were used in the Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) battleships."
 SOV_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lenin-class battleship was a hypothetical design to match and counter the German Bismarck and U.S. South Dakota class battleships. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets would provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armour, and large engines would ensure its survival in battle."
 SOV_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Stalingrad class (Project 82) capital ships were intended to provide the Soviet navy with its primary firepower in the post WWII era. They were fast, well-armed, and well-armoured vessels. Construction started after the war, but the death of Josif Stalin led to the cancellation of these ships, though there were projects to finish at least one as a modified design equipped with Soviet V-2 missiles."
 SOV_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23) was the last class of battleships built by the Soviet shipyards and were authorised in the 1938-43 shipbuilding programme. Four ships were planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also had strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armour. The outbreak of the war prevented these ships from being completed."
 SOV_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Project 23bis-class battleships were a modified and improved version of the previous Sovetsky Soyuz-class (Project 23). Compared to their predecessors, they carried four triple turrets of the same 406mm calibre cannons, thickened belt armour, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament."
 SOV_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail class aircraft carrier was the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship would have a thick armour belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group would provide her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out due to costs and the state of the Soviet shipbuilding industry after the October Revolution."
 SOV_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Krasnyi Vozdukh-class aircraft carrier was a hypothetical design to provide the Soviet navy air projection over its fleets. They were similar in size to the British Ark Royal or Japanese Hiryu classes but carried additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armour results in a slightly reduced air group compared to these classes."
 SOV_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Project 71B carriers were designed in the mid-to-late 1930's. They were planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets Stalin ordered in his plan. Two ships were planned that would displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armour, and an adequate air group. The German invasion caused the cancellation of construction for these vessels."
 SOV_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Project 72 aircraft carriers were the improved versions of the previous Project 71 ships. Design studies finished in the early 1940's resulting in a larger ship with thinner armour. The extra space was used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."
 USA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Balao Class was a continuation of the design rooted in the Tambor class. Improvements came in the form of hull reinforcement and upgrading the deck gun to a 5"/24 calibre along with numerous subtle design improvements."
 USA_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Clemson Class destroyer continued with many design elements of its immediate predecessor, the Wickes Class. The Clemson had improved sea handling over the Wickes Class and was armed with 4"/50 calibre main guns, a 3"/23 calibre AA gun and 12 torpedo tubes. The class was ageing and was nearly obsolete, but still comprised the bulk of the US Navy's Destroyer force."
 USA_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Sims Class was the largest "1500 Tonner" design with a more streamlined torpedo arrangement and longer hull. Improvement in fire control granted better attack capabilities with its 5"/38 calibre guns and included 12 centreline torpedo tubes."
 USA_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Fletcher Class represented a large step forward in terms of destroyer capability, thanks largely to its increase to 2500 tons. While keeping the 5"/38 dual purpose guns and centreline torpedo arrangement, the class added an additional single turret and received significant increases in AA weaponry as well as improved range and larger displacement."
 USA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sumner Class continued on the Fletcher Class with displacement only marginally increased. The ship was able to take on more armament gaining dual 5"/38 calibre guns and a much larger complement of AA weaponry. The addition of a second rudder allowed for improve manoeuvring during ASW operations."
 USA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Omaha Class was initially designed to fill a key scouting role in the US Navy's WW1 fleet. A fast and capable class, the Omaha Class was armed with a formidable load out of 6"/53 calibre guns in an 8x1 and 2x2 turret configuration and six torpedo launchers. The Omaha Class was ageing but comprised of the bulk of the US Navy's Light Cruiser force."
 USA_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Brooklyn Class was designed with the Washington Naval Treaty in mind and so was restricted to 6" guns. To maximise firepower, the Brooklyn's was armed with 15 of the new Mk16 6" guns in triple turrets. The overall design was very balanced and was considered as the basis of all future cruiser designs for the US Navy."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Pensacola Class were designed under the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, and sought to maximize firepower under the 8" gun restriction. It was armed with a formidable armament of 10 x 8"/55 guns. The hull armour was thin and the design was top heavy but capable. It formed the bulk of the US Navy's Heavy Cruiser force."
 USA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Wichita Class ships improved armament over the Pensacola Class and its variants with a new turret design for its 8"55 calibre guns and improved the fields of fire for its secondary armament of 5"/38 guns. "
 USA_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Baltimore Class brought together the more successful elements of previous cruiser designs and was based largely off of the Brooklyn Class light cruiser married with configurations with armament and armour from the USS Wichita."
 USA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The New York Class battleships were the first US Battleships to be armed with the 14"/45 calibre main guns. Numerous 5"/51 guns provided secondary armament and over 10" of armour."
 USA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The North Carolina Class was a challenging design and was the first battleship class built by the US Navy in 20 years. The US Navy required this class to meet the standards of Washington Naval Treaty, limited to 36,000 tons yet be armed with the 16"/45 calibre guns and have improved armour while being capable of escorting the US Navy's fast aircraft carriers."
 USA_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Illinois Class continued with the design and role defined by the Iowa Class. It maintained speed and armament over armour. The Illinois Class increased the number of 16"/50 calibre guns from 9 to 12 while it also improved boilers and machinery in order to provide more efficient high cruise speeds. Like the Montana Class, initial designs included four 4 6" guns dual turrets, but this was reverted to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements to maximise AA capabilities."
 USA_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ranger Class was the first US Navy class designed as a carrier from the keel up. As part of a US Navy smaller carrier concept the class was much smaller than the previous Lexington Class, yet still retained the same air group complement thanks to improvements on interior designs."
 USA_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Midway Class was the ultimate in US Navy carrier capability. Implementing an armoured deck and able to carry far more aircraft than previous classes, the Midway Class was being given a unique sub-class designation, CVB (Carrier Vessel Battle)."
 USA_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "In 1920 the construction of the large South Dakota Class battleships fielding 12 x 16"/50 guns started. The class would have ushered in a new era in heavy battleship design but was cancelled in 1922 to conform to the Washington Naval Treaty. With the Treaty no longer in effect and the threat of a secret Japanese battleship project we can modernise the design, increase displacement to over 55,000 tons and up gun the design with 18"/50 calibre guns to create a new class of heavy battleship."
 USA_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Montana Class was bigger and more armoured than the Illinois Class, sacrificing speed to accommodate the increase. Its main armament of 12 x 18"/50 calibre guns and with our latest fire control system the Montana's firepower will be unmatched. Initial designs included 6" guns, but this was changed to return to the dual purpose 5" twin turret emplacements."
 ARG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Garibaldi class represents a class of armoured cruisers built for Argentina around the turn of the century. All were obsolete by the mid-1930s, with the last one being decommissioned by 1932. They were replaced in 1931 by the British-built Veinticinco de Mayo-class heavy cruisers."
 AST_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Programme as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 AST_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programmes. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 AST_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes, which were transferred to the RAN to form the 'Scrap Iron Flotilla'. They were built under the War Emergency Programme. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 AST_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programmes. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 AST_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Nizam class was the designation of the J, K, and N class destroyers transferred from the RN. They were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasising gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 AST_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programmes. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels."
 AST_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armoured, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 AST_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armoured but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 AST_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorised in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armour belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Programme. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armour, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armour, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 AST_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armour. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 AST_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and manoeuvrable, but had thinner armour and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 AST_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy with quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armour would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 AST_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-calibre cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller calibre, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 AST_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Programme to replace the ageing Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armour and more powerful engines."
 AST_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theatre. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Programme, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armour made the vessel fast and well protected."
 AST_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armour provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 AST_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armour plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 AST_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armoured but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 AST_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armoured and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 AST_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armoured flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armour and AA weaponry provided a strong defence for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 AST_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armour on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 BRA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Bahia class was a class of two British-built scout cruisers built for Brazil and delivered in 1910. The ships were heavily refit and modernised in the 1920s but were still a relatively obsolete design by the start of World War II. During the war, the cruisers primarily performed convoy escort duties."
 BRA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Minas Gerais was a class of two dreadnought battleships built by the U.K. for Brazil in the early 1900s. They were active during World War II but far too obsolete for any serious duty, instead being used as coastal defence ships along the Brazilian coast."

Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armour would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 CAN_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-calibre cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller calibre, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 CAN_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Programme to replace the ageing Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armour and more powerful engines."
 CAN_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theatre. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Programme, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, which gave it an excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armour made the vessel fast and well protected."
 CAN_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armour provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 CAN_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armour plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 CAN_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armoured but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 CAN_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armoured and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 CAN_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armoured flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armour and AA weaponry provided a strong defence for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 CAN_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armour on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 CHI_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Jianwei-class was a class of large torpedo boats built for the Nationalist Chinese navy and commissioned in 1904. Two ships of the class were modernised and still in service at the time of the Japanese invasion. Once modernised, they displaced 870 tons and were armed with two 4.7 in. main guns."
 CHL_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Chacabuco was a protected cruiser that was built in Britain and commissioned for the Chilean Navy in 1902. It displaced 4,160 tons and was armed with two Armstrong 8 in. main guns and three 18 in. torpedo tubes. It was slow but well-armoured compared to early light cruisers."
 CHL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The O'Higgins was an armoured cruiser built at the turn of the 20th century in Britain for the Chilean Navy. It displaced 7,800 tons, had four 8 in. and 45 calibre guns as its main armament, but was fairly slow compared to the heavy cruisers built following World War I."
 CHL_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Almirante Latorre class consisted of two super-dreadnought battleships built in Britain for the Chilean Navy at the outbreak of World War I. Only one was finished as a battleship, with the other being converted to the HMS Eagle aircraft carrier. The ships displaced over 28,000 tons and had a main armament of ten 14 in./45 calibre BL guns. They were less armoured but somewhat faster than other dreadnoughts of their era."
 DEN_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Herluf Trolle class represented three ironclad coastal battleships commissioned between 1901 and 1908. Despite the battleship classification, they were closer to a cruiser in size and armament. Only one, Peter Skram, was in service at the start of World War II. The ships displaced over 3,700 tons, were armed with two 240mm/K43 guns in their main armament, and were well-armoured, though they were slower than most dreadnought battleships of its era."
 FIN_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Väinämöinen class consisted of two coastal defence battleships built and commissioned in Finland in the early 1930s. They were among the last coastal defence ships ever built, though their size and armament were closer to that of a heavy cruiser. They displaced only 3,900 tons and were fairly slow, but were armed with four 254mm/45 calibre Bofors guns."
 GRE_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Aetos-class destroyers were built in Britain and bought for the Hellenic Navy prior to World War I. All four were in service during World War II. They displaced 980 tons and were armed with four 105mm/40 Armstrong P guns and four 533mm torpedo tubes. They were modernised in the late 1920s."
 GRE_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Leon class was a class of U.S. Cannon-class destroyer escorts. They were commissioned in 1943 but not delivered to the Hellenic Navy until 1951. The ships were slower than a standard destroyer. They displaced 1,240 tons and had three 3 in./40 calibre guns as their main armament, as well as a strong complement of torpedoes and ASW equipment."
 GRE_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Elli was a light cruiser built by the U.S. in 1914. It was originally intended for the Chinese Navy, but was eventually delivered to Greece. It was small for a cruiser, displacing only 2,600 tons. It had two 152mm/45 calibre guns as its main armament. The ship served during World War II and was sunk by an Italian sub prior to the Axis invasion of Greece."
 GRE_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Averof was an armoured cruiser that was built in Italy for the Hellenic Navy prior to World War I. She served throughout World War II as the flagship of the fleet. The Averof was quite powerful compared to cruisers of her time, displacing nearly 10,000 tons. She was very well-armoured and had a main armament of four 234mm/45 Armstrong guns. Despite all of this, she was relatively fast for an armoured cruiser."
 GRE_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Kilkis class consisted of two U.S. Mississippi-class battleships that were commissioned in 1908 and sold to Greece in 1914. They were the last pre-dreadnought battleships built by the U.S. They displaced only 13,000 tons and were armed with four 10 in./45 calibre Mk V guns in their main armament. They had average armament, speed, and range for their vintage. Both ships were retired by 1936."
 HOL_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Dutch commissioned two Java-class light cruisers in the mid-1920s. The ships were designed in Germany but constructed in the Netherlands. They displaced nearly 6,700 tons and had a main armament of ten 150mm Bofors guns. They were lightly armoured and had decent speed for their vintage."
 HOL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The De Zeven Provinciën class consisted of two cruisers laid down just before the German invasion but not completed until 1951. The final design was modified from the original 1939 plan, and led to two ships that displaced over 12,000 tons and were armed with eight Bofors 152mm cannon. They were well-armoured for a light cruiser and had good range."
 HOL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Dutch cruiser Soerabaja, originally named De Zeven Provinciën, was a coastal defence ship ('panterschip') built and commissioned in the Netherlands prior to World War I. She displaced over 6,500 tons and was armed with two 280mm and four 150mm guns as her main armament. She served during World War II until she was sunk by Japanese bombers in 1942."
 NOR_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Norge was a coastal defence ship built for Norway in Britain at the turn of the century. Its armament, which centred around two 210mm guns, was comparable to a heavy cruiser, though its size, which displaced just over 4,200 tons, was closer to a light cruiser. Its speed was comparable to a dreadnought battleship. It was one of four coastal defence ships of its era that was still serving the Royal Norwegian Navy at the start of World War II."
 NZL_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Programme as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 NZL_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programmes. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 NZL_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Programme. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 NZL_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programmes. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 NZL_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasising gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 NZL_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programmes. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 NZL_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armoured, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 NZL_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Gambia class was the New Zeland designation for British Crown Colony-class light cruisers. These were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armoured but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 NZL_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Black Prince class was the Canadian designation for British Minotaur-class (or Swiftsure-class) light cruisers. These cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorised in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armour belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Programme. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armour, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armour, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 NZL_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armour. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 NZL_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser.

They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armour on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 SAF_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Emergency War Programme as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of World War I and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They served until the beginning of World War II when they were mostly used for secondary and training duties."
 SAF_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the War Emergency 1940 and 1941 Programmes. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 SAF_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admirality and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the War Emergency Programme. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First World War, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WWI and became the backbone of the Royal Navy's destroyer flotillas afterwards. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 SAF_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programmes. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes was the same as in the F class, with both using on the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 SAF_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasising gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 SAF_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Battle class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programmes. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels. Their late introduction to the war led to a minimal contribution."
 SAF_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Southampton-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the Japanese Mogami-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armoured, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 SAF_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Crown Colony-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armoured but because of their smaller engines, their range was somewhat reduced. The type included two subclasses: Fiji and Ceylon."
 SAF_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Crown Colony class, incorporating war modifications that were authorised in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Crown Colony class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. Built too late to affect the outcome of the war, most of the ordered vessels were cancelled afterwards. "
 SAF_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armour belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection. Altogether, five ships were commissioned but only four were active at the start of WWII."
 SAF_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Surrey-class heavy cruisers were proposed under the 1928 Naval Programme. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they would have been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armour, and more powerful engines. Two ships were ordered but none were laid down."
 SAF_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Admiral-class heavy cruisers (not to be confused with the Admiral-class battlecruisers) were the Royal Navy's last attempt to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armour, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 SAF_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "These ships were proposed by Sir Winston Churchill, Lord of the Admirality, in the early stages of WWII to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels would have had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armour. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships. The ships were eventually cancelled because of high costs and a lack of demand for a new heavy cruiser. "
 SAF_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Renown-class battlecruisers were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WWI. Admiral Lord Fisher managed to restart their construction as battlecruisers. These ships were the quintessential battlecruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and manoeuvrable, but had thinner armour and a shorter operational range. Only two of the original three ships, Repulse and Renown, were completed."
 SAF_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Princess Royal was a class of hypothetical battlecruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the King George V-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Royal Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armour would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 SAF_battleship_2_desc:0 "The King George V-class battleships were the result of the 1922 Washington and 1930 First London Naval Treaties which limited the maximum displacement and gunnery of capital ships. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-calibre cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller calibre, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. Five ships were ordered and laid down as replacement for the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships."
 SAF_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lion-class battleships were the follow-up class to King George V battleships, incorporating many of their features. Six ships were ordered in the 1938 Naval Programme to replace the ageing Revenge-class battleships but none were finished due to the erupting hostilities. The vessels would have been general similar to the King George-class, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have thicker armour and more powerful engines."
 SAF_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Vanguard-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Royal Navy. A single ship was ordered but four more were considered for the Pacific theatre. Ordered under the 1940 Emergency War Programme, construction did not gain a high priority and it was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament was the same as the Queen Elizabeth and Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armour made the vessel fast and well protected."
 SAF_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Centurion was a class of hypothetical heavy battleships of the Royal Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German and Japanese navies. Large 18 in. guns and thick armour provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the vast seas of the British Empire."
 SAF_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Lion II class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armour plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 SAF_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battlecruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Royal Navy. Their conversion was the result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 and the work was finished in 1925. They were moderately-armoured but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement was limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Royal Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 SAF_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Ark Royal aircraft carrier was the first such vessel to be built to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty. She was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel was well-armoured and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the major forces of the Royal Navy."
 SAF_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Illustrious class was designed within the restrictions of the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936, which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armoured flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armour and AA weaponry provided a strong defence for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range. "
 SAF_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Programme and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Illustrious class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armour on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Illustrious class."
 SIA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Taskin class consisted of a pair of light cruisers built in Italy. They were launched in 1941 but were requisitioned by the Siamese navy in 1942. They were to become the Etna-class Italian AA cruisers of the Regia Marina but were never completed before the Italian armistice. They would have displaced 5,900 tons and been armed with six 152mm/53 OTO 1929 guns in their main armament. They would have had decent armour but would be fairly slow for a cruiser."
 SIA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Sri Ayuthia class coastal defence ships were perhaps the last ships of this type built in the world, with both ships of the class built in Japan and commissioned for the Royal Thai Navy in 1938. The design was comparable to a small cruiser (or large destroyer) in size, to a battleship in speed, and to a heavy cruiser in armament. Its main guns were four 203mm/53 3-Shiki cannon. They were lightly armoured compared to contemporary heavy cruisers."
 SPA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Méndez Núñes-class light cruisers were a pair of cruisers built within Spain for the Spanish Navy in the early 1920s. The ships were ordered in 1915 but materials shortages during World War I delayed construction. The design was heavily influenced by the British C-class cruisers. The cruisers displaced nearly 4,800 tons but was relatively slow. Its main armament consisted of six 152mm/50 Vickers Mk V guns. It also had good armour and a dozen 533mm torpedo tubes."
 SPA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Princesa de Asturias class consisted of three armoured cruisers built for the Spanish Navy around the turn of the century. All three had been either scrapped or wrecked by the mid-1930s. They were armed with twin 240mm Guillén M1896 and eight 140mm/33 Schneider-Canet guns. They were heavily armoured but also somewhat slow compared to a standard heavy cruiser."
 SPA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The two heavy cruisers of the Canarias class were built to the specifications of the Washington Naval treay. They were launched in the early 1930s but not completed until 1936. They displaced nearly 10,700 tons and had good speed. They were relatively lightly armoured but sported eight 203mm/50 Vickers-Armstrong Mk D guns as their main armament."
 SPA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The España class was originally a class of three dreadnought battleships that were commissioned around the time of World War I, though one had wrecked by the time of the Spanish Civil War. The other two were lost during the war. They were fairly small for a battleship, displacing just over 15,400 tons. They had decent armour and decent speed, however, and had a main battery of eight 305mm/50 Vickers H guns. "

 SWE_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Fylgia was a relatively small armoured cruiser that was commissioned for the Swedish Navy in 1905. The performed mostly training duties during the war, and underwent an extensive refit in 1939-41. Prior to the refit, she displaced over 4,300 tons and was armed with six 152mm/45 K/50 M1903 guns in her main armament. She had good armour, but was relatively slow for a cruiser."
 SWE_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Sverige class consisted of three coastal battleships built for the Swedish Navy before World War I. The ships more closely resembled heavy cruisers in both size (displacement of over 6,800 tons) and armament (four 283mm/44 K/45 M12 guns). The ships were relatively slow for a cruiser but were very well-armoured. All three ships served during World War II."
 TUR_submarine_2_desc:0 "The three submarines of the Saldiray class were launched in the late 1930s. Their design was heavily influenced by Germany, with the first ship of the class built in Germany, and the other two built under licence in Istanbul. They were large ocean-going submarines, displacing over 930 tons and with excellent range. They were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes."
 TUR_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Turkish ship Mecidiye was a protected cruiser built in the U.S. for the Ottoman Navy at the turn of the century. She was actually sunk in shallow water during World War II, but was raised and after a brief stint as part of the Imperial Russian Navy, was returned to Turkey. She displaced just under 3,500 tons and was armed with two 152mm/44 Bethlehem No. 2 and eight 120mm/45 Armstrong Y guns. They had decent range but were relatively slow and lightly armoured."
 TUR_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Yavuz was originally commissioned as the German battlecruiser Goeben but was sold to the Ottomans and recommissioned in 1914 to avoid internment. She displaced just under 23,000 tons and had decent speed and range. She was well-armoured and was armed with ten 283mm/47 SK L/50 guns as well as a strong secondary armament."
 TUR_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Reşadiye class represents three dreadnought battleships ordered from the U.K. for the Turkish Navy just prior to World War I. Only one of the ships were completed, however, and it was subsequently interned by the British at the start of World War I. The ships would have displaced 23,000 tons and would have had good armour, speed, and range. Their main armament would have had ten 343mm/45 Vickers guns."
 VIC_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Minerve-class submarines (Project name T2) were based on the 630-ton Series though they had better engines and different torpedo layout. These submarines were the first part of the standardisation programme resulting of a centralised design of the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale), a rather specific shipyard design of the previous classes."
 VIC_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Phénix-class submarines were medium sized ocean-going and long range boats authorised in the 1939-40 naval programmes but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these boats. They were similar to the Redoutable class though they were smaller and displaced 1,200 tons. They carried a similarly heavy torpedo armament."
 VIC_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Le Fantasque-class destroyers were essentially improved versions of the earlier super destroyers of the 2,400-ton Series (Guépard, Aigle, Vauquelin) built under the 1930 naval programme. They were large, heavily-armed, and very fast destroyers, perfect for escorting the new high speed units of the French fleet. Their armament consisted of newly developed guns, adequate AA, and torpedo armament."
 VIC_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The L'Intrépide-class destroyers were a modified version of the earlier Le Hardi class destroyers. They were authorised in the 1938 and 1939 naval programmes but the war and Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these vessels. They would have been focussed more on an anti-aircraft role, with an increase in displacement to 2,800-2,900 tons and larger engines."
 VIC_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Hoche and Bayard classes were the final super destroyer design of the French Navy. Both classes were based on the Mogador class, displacing 4,200 tons with a similar main armament but improved AA guns and stronger engines. They were authorised in the 1939-40 naval programmes but the start of the war and the Fall of France resulted in the cancellation of these ships."
 VIC_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Duguay-Trouin light cruisers were the first major French warships built after World War I in the 1922 naval programme. They became the first light cruisers with super-firing enclosed main turrets. Among light cruisers, they had a strong torpedo armament but virtually nonexistent armour."
 VIC_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The La Galissonnière-class light cruisers were the answer to the Italian Condottieri type light cruisers and were based on the previous Emile Bertin class. They were built in the 1931 and 1932 naval programmes, with typical main armament and adequate AA armament of the era. They displaced 10,850 tons, had an increased amount of scout planes, and had good speed."
 VIC_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The DeGrasse-class cruisers were authorised in the 1938 and 1939 naval programmes and were essentially improved La Galissonnières. They had stronger AA armament, as well as bigger engines. The Fall of France caused the last two ships to be cancelled and the lead ship to be finished post-war as a different design. The Germans intended to finish her as a light carrier but this project was also not carried out."
 VIC_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Colbert was an anti-aircraft light cruiser launched in 1956. This Colbert-class cruiser was built in a very similar way to the post-war De Grasse, featuring heavy AA armament both for long and short ranges. The difference between Colbert and DeGrasse was that the Colbert had smaller engines, thinner armour, and was slightly smaller."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Suffren-class heavy cruisers were basically a repeat of the previous Duquesne class with minor improvements regarding its seagoing abilities. Both classes resembled the contemporary cruiser philosophy of the French navy: very thin armour but good speed and range. Their standard displacement is 10,000 tons and they were equipped with armaments that were standard for a heavy cruiser."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Algérie-class heavy cruiser were a further improvement of the previous classes of the Suffren and Duquesne but designed to be the opponent of the new Italian heavy cruisers of the Zara class. Both the main armour belt and underwater protection was considerably increased. Its AA armament was adequate for its time, but due to these changes, the standard displacement was over 10,000 tons."
 VIC_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Saint Louis-class heavy cruisers were based on the Algérie class but the overall look was closer to that of the Dunkerque and Richelieu class capital ships. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval programme, but due to the Fall of France none of them were laid down. They would field new guns and improved AA armament but the armour would be the same as on the Algérie class. It was the last heavy cruiser design of the French Navy."
 VIC_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Durand-Viel design of battlecruiser was a proposal among a series of studies dating back to WWI. They were essentially the battlecruiser versions of the Normandie and Lyon classes of battleship featuring the same quad turrets and guns though in reduced number. Like contemporary battlecruisers of other navies, they would be faster but less armoured than a battleship. They were cancelled before WWI broke out."
 VIC_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Dunkerques were designed to counter the German Deutschland-class pocket battleships. They were the apex of a series design studies from the mid 1920's to early 1930's. authorised in the 1931 and 1934 naval programmes, they were similar to the British Nelson-class battleships, with all of their main turrets concentrated forward. This resulted in a shorter belt armour and thus a smaller ship to fit into the Naval Treaties limitations."
 VIC_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Courbet-class battleships were the first super-dreadnoughts built for the French Navy before and during the First World War. authorised in the 1910 and 1911 naval programmes, they saw limited service during World War I, but were active during WW2. Though they had thicker armour and stronger guns than the previous Dante class battleships, they were still inferior to contemporary USN and RN battleships. They displaced just over 22,000 tons and their only modernisations before WW2 were an improved AA armament and improved boilers."
 VIC_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Richelieu-class battleships were the last battleships commissioned into the French Navy. They were an improved design of the Dunkerque and authorised under the 1935 and 1938 naval programmes. They had excellent AA armament, speed and range, which made it an excellent capital ship. Out of the four ordered, only two were launched and one was completed before the Fall of France. There were numerous attempts to finish the remaining ships using different designs, proposed for use as anti-aircraft battleships, battleship-carrier hybrids, or full scale carriers."
 VIC_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Gascogne class of battleships were a subclass of the Richelieu class. Three ships were ordered in the 1940 naval programme but none were started. The design would be a repeat of the Richelieu, but with the main armament distributed evenly fore and aft, improved AA Armament, and improved engines resulting in an overall better ship."
 VIC_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Alsace-class battleships were planned to succeed the Richelieu class. Four ships were ordered, with the design studies finished in 1939, authorised in 1940, and expected to be laid down in 1941, though the Fall of France prevented this from happening. It improved upon the Richelieu design with heavier and more numerous main guns, stronger AA armament, thicker armour plates, and larger engines."
 VIC_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Charlemagne class of super battleships was a hypothetical design to match the big battleships of other navies. They featured a heavy armament all forward in superfiring positions, heavy AA armament, and thick armour. The entire design borrowed elements from the Richelieu and British Nelson classes."
 VIC_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Napoléon Bonaparte-class battleships were a hypothetical design and based on the Alsace and Gascogne classes. Its heavy armament was distributed evenly fore and aft in triple turrets, with superfiring secondaries and heavy AA armament. Thick armour and strong engines provided the speed and defence needed to keep up with the other ships in the fleet and effectively battle its adversaries."
 VIC_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Béarn was originally laid down as a Normandie-class battleship but later finished as an aircraft carrier, displacing 22,100 tons and serving during the interbellum years and WWII. As a converted carrier, its speed was slow and it had limited space for aircraft, but the medium armour belt and long range made up for these shortcomings. Its construction gave important experience to the French designers in the DCAN (Direction des Constructions et Armes Navale) and led to a series of design studies afterward."
 VIC_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Joffre-class carriers (Project name PA-16) were the next generation of carriers for the French Navy. It was the last of the design studies that started in 1929 and ended in 1937. Two ships were authorised in the 1938 naval programme, but the escalating conflicts slowed down the construction process and eventually the Fall of France prevented the completion of these ships. Displacement would be around 20,000 tons. They would have good AA armament, armour, and speed, but a below-average aircraft complement. Overall, it would have been a well-rounded and versatile carrier for the French Navy."
 VIC_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Jean Bart carrier was a mid-war proposal to convert the unfinished Richelieu class battleship Jean Bart into a full scale carrier in a similar way to the Japanese IJN Shinano. The hull's large size would be resulted in a large aircraft component and together with the big engines a long range and fast carrier. The heavy AA armament of US origin would have provided a good defence against aircraft and smaller surface combatants."
