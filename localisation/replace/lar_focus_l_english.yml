 SPA_a_great_spain_desc:1 "The fledgling Second Republic has failed in its duties to protect religion, family, and property. As the Left beleaguers our Christian civilisation, the Confederación Española de Derechas Autónomas will stand in its defence and give Spain true unity and a new spirit. Parliament will submit to the will of the people, or we will eliminate it."
 SPA_negotiate_carlist_support_desc:1 "Our cause has allies we but need to reach out to. Anti-clerical sentiment from the Left has antagonised the Carlists, who have long been preparing for a confrontation with the Republic. Should we gain their support, our uprising will be much strengthened."
 SPA_the_army_of_africa_desc:1 "The key to victory in the upcoming struggle is the seasoned Army of Africa. We must ensure their loyalty to our cause, draw up plans for the lightning occupation of North Africa, and then prepare the transfer of these battle-hardened troops to the mainland where they can swing the balance in our favour."
 SPR_secure_the_guardia_de_asalto_desc:1 "The polarisation of society is increasing, and violence along with it. We must ensure the loyalty of the Assault Guards, our well-trained heavy police reserve. They will be invaluable if the violence continues to escalate."
 SPR_distribute_arms_to_the_people_desc:1 "Disloyalty in the military is now all but certain, and it is clear we cannot rely on them to defend the values of the Republic. We should begin disseminating arms to those who carry the best interests of the Republic at heart, so that they may form the first defence against a possible rebellion."
 SPA_the_fifth_column_desc:1 "In the words of Emilio Mola: "As my four columns approach Madrid, a fifth column of supports will rise up from inside the city and undermine the Republican defences from within". We will organize these 'Fifth Columns' in all cities we approach, giving us a decisive advantage."
 SPA_emergency_munitions_corporations_desc:1 "The war effort requires immediate strengthening if we are to maintain adequate levels of supplies for our brave troops. We will organise those who do not fight into make-shift workshops that will make the most basic of necessities for our troops."
 SPA_secure_the_national_defense_council:0 "Secure the National Defence Council"
 SPA_secure_the_national_defense_council_desc:1 "Leaderless, our cause is headed by a Junta of military and civilian leaders with loosely-aligned goals. If we are to drive through our will and achieve the rebirth Spain deserves, we must secure dominance over this varied, and sometimes squabbling, organisation."
 SPA_expand_conscription_desc:1 "The civil war is taking its toll on our country, but we cannot ease our pressure on the Republicans. A renewed push is required, fuelled by a renewed recruitment effort."
 SPA_safeguard_the_freedom_of_worship_desc:1 "The Republicans threaten the faith in God itself, and we must make it clear to everyone that we are Christianity's last bastion. We will protect all Christians' right and freedom of worship, and all who wish may join our fight in their defence."
 SPA_prepare_the_pyrenees_defenses:0 "Prepare the Pyrenees Defences"
 SPA_prepare_the_pyrenees_defenses_desc:1 "Rumours have reached us that the Republicans have reached out to [FRA.GetNameDef] with their pleas for help. Though unlikely, we cannot take the risk that this is true and leave our northern borders undefended. Defensive preparations must be begun at once in the eventuality of [FRA.GetAdjective] intervention."
 SPA_regional_agrarian_commissions_desc:1 "The countryside has been ravaged by the war.

 SPA_syndicalize_production_desc:1 "Our movement sets itself apart from both capitalism and communism. Instead, we will create national syndicates where employees and employers can work together to maximise productivity for the betterment of all of Spain."
 SPA_retake_the_americas_desc:2 "The greater of the Latin American powers have no intention to accept our leadership willingly - nor shall we regain our old possessions from [USA.GetNameDef] without a fight. Though the challenge is great, the realisation of our imperial ambitions is nigh, if only we can surmount it."

 SPA_fascist_economic_aid_desc:1 "The civil war has ravaged our nation, but perhaps our new allies might be willing to aid our rebuilding programmes."
 SPA_unify_the_nationalist_front_desc:1 "The rebellion, or "Nationalists" as they have begun to call themselves, are a loose assortment of groups united only in their desire to overthrow the Republic. The way to success lies in avoiding infighting and focussing on the struggle against our common foe"
 SPA_extol_the_martyrs_of_the_war_desc:1 "Those who have laid down their lives for our cause should be remembered and honoured for their sacrifice. Their actions should serve as an example to us all."
 SPA_a_methodical_approach_desc:1 "The key to success in this civil war lies not in bold manoeuvres and reckless attacks, but in careful and methodical planning and deliberate and precise attacks."
 SPA_tackle_the_vulnerable_fronts_desc:1 "Vulnerabilities have been observed in certain parts of the enemy frontline. We should focus on these areas to maximise the effect of our offensives."
 SPA_portuguese_aid_desc:1 "We must accept aid from wherever it may come. Portugal, having harboured many of our leaders who were forced to flee after the failed 1932 rebellion, might be willing to provide us with materiel aid should we ask, and this may even form the basis for even closer collaboration in the future."
 SPA_utilize_the_intellectuals:0 "Utilise the Intellectuals"
 SPA_the_stabilization_plan:0 "The Stabilisation Plan"
 SPA_the_stabilization_plan_desc:1 "We must steer away from the unreasonable Falangist dream of autarky and the untenable economic policies implemented in its pursuit. To achieve economic parity with the rest of the world we must look at economic liberalisation instead, hopefully triggering an economic boom that will benefit all Spaniards."
 SPA_the_spanish_miracle_desc:1 "The Stabilisation Plan has paid off beyond our wildest dreams; the economic boom we are experiencing can only be called a miracle!"

 SPA_no_compromise_on_carlist_ideals_desc:2 "Though we co-operated with the Falange in our initial uprising, it is now clear to us that compromising on our ideals is tantamount to treason. If the Falange does not accept our demands, then we have no choice but to eliminate them, too."
 SPA_militarize_the_masses:0 "Militarize the Masses"
 SPA_militarize_the_masses_desc:1 "The values for which we stand cannot be defended by our Requetés alone. All who are loyal to the Crown and bear the love of God in their hearts must do their military duty in the defence of their ideals."
 SPA_battle_rites_desc:2 "Warfare in defence of our nation is a sacred duty. Our chaplains will accompany the soldiers on the battlefield and administer the last rites on the spot for any who give the ultimate sacrifice for King and Faith, ensuring that all are rewarded in Heaven."
 SPA_encourage_local_industrialization:0 "Encourage Local Industrialisation"
 SPA_encourage_local_industrialization_desc:1 "Industrialisation should be encouraged by our various regional governments, as local initiatives like this will undoubtedly serve to strengthen the nation as a whole."
 SPA_dios_patria_rey_desc:1 "The rallying cry of the Carlist echoes through history and exemplifies the beliefs we hold to be true. It serves as a reminder that we all play but a small part in the defence of Catholicism, our local communities and the Spanish nation as a whole, and the ultimate sovereignty of our King. God, Fatherland, and King!"
 SPA_rebuild_the_battlefleet_desc:1 "For four decades after the Spanish-American War has our navy been lethargic and timid. The addition of new major warships capable of meeting any foe will instill a sense of rebirth in its ranks, as well as allowing us to contest seas with our neighbours."
 SPR_regional_defense_council_of_aragon:0 "Regional Defence Council of Aragon"
 SPR_regional_defense_council_of_aragon_desc:1 "For the purposes of warfare, and by necessity only, the autonomous anarchist communes that have arisen as a result of the Civil War must be united under a singular Defence Council that can coordinate our efforts. We will begin by establishing one in Aragon."
 SPR_appropriate_the_means_of_production_desc:1 "Gone are the days when we worked for the wealthy. Gone are the days when our labour went unrewarded. We shall seize the factories and the workshops, the farms and the stores, eliminating class and putting the worker in charge of their own destiny."
 SPR_autogestion_desc:1 "We will maximise output by allowing the workers to engage in workplace self-management according to the principles of autogestión. This will grant many benefits in terms of worker autonomy, morale, and, as a result, overall productivity."
 SPR_collectivization_and_workers_control:0 "Collectivisation And Workers' Control"
 SPR_collectivization_and_workers_control_desc:1 "For the necessary aspects of local government we will turn to workers' councils, giving every worker a say while also enabling larger-scale co-operation."
 SPR_arm_the_people_desc:1 "A national army can easily be used as a way for the government to maintain control over its populace, and so is no recourse for communal defence. It is the people themselves who must be given the arms with which to defend their communities."
 SPR_the_maximum_concession_desc:1 "In the spirit of fighting fascism we have made the greatest concession possible: co-operation with the capitalists and authoritarian communists. This concession is as far as we are willing to go, and it cannot last forever. We shall make the most of it while it does."
 SPR_agrarian_collectivization:0 "Agrarian Collectivisation"
 SPR_agrarian_collectivization_desc:1 "Collectivised organisation of our agriculture will ensure all who live in the communes have the food they require, rather than sell the harvests where they make the most profit."
 SPR_literacy_programs:0 "Literacy Programmes"
 SPR_literacy_programs_desc:1 "Illiteracy is wide-spread among the worker population, but with the proper programmes this can be improved rapidly, no doubt allowing hidden talent to emerge."
 SPR_shared_burdens_desc:2 "The fight for our freedoms from authoritarianism, capitalism, and religious superstitions will be long and hard. We must all do our part in carrying the hardships that no doubt await us, before we can all reap the rewards of our labour."
 SPR_international_brigades_desc:1 "Our cause has attracted much international attention, and people have come from all over the world to fight the fascist threat with us. No one will be turned away, as long as they do their part for the health of the community. We will organise them in international brigades."

 SPR_portuguese_anarchism_desc:1 "Our war for freedom has spilled over the Portuguese border, and the government is being destabilised. With the proper support, it is not unthinkable a full-scale anarchist uprising might occur within their borders. We must light this flame!"

 SPR_communal_military_strategies_desc:1 "Organising large-scale warfare while remaining true to the tenets of anarchism is a great challenge. It is also one that we must rise to meet, as without it all that we fight for is lost."
 SPR_torchbearers_of_tomorrow_desc:1 "Those who do their part in the support of our cause, be it through intellectual or military pursuits, are the very future incarnate. This realisation may well be a powerful driving force, and so we must make sure they are aware of the importance of their work."
 SPR_improve_military_infrastructure_desc:1 "To reach besieged communes in time we must greatly improve our intercommunal infrastructure. This should allow the Defence Council as a whole to rapidly respond to any outside threats that any individual commune might not be equipped to deal with."
 SPR_fortify_la_linea_de_la_concepcion_desc:1 "La Línea de la Concepción is the first bastion against the enemy that lies beyond. With adequate defences we should be able to meet any attack that comes from Gibraltar head-on."
 SPR_fortify_the_coastlines_desc:1 "We cannot discount the possibility of naval invasion. Expanded defences should make this a much less palatable prospect for the enemy than if we remain defenceless on this frontier."
 SPR_militarize_the_industry:0 "Militarise the Industry"
 SPR_communal_autarky_desc:1 "The world has shunned us, and so we must make do with the natural resources that we find in our own territory. This is an exercise in optimisation that we will learn to excel at."
 SPR_militarize_the_people:0 "Militarise the People"
 SPR_militarize_the_people_desc:1 "We do not have the luxury of keeping our hands clean from blood. All must be taught to wield a weapon in self-defence, so that when the time comes they may fight for their future."
 SPR_anarchism_knows_no_borders_desc:1 "If the nations of the world do not wish to tolerate us among them, then our only recourse for a future in which we may collectivise in peace is the very abolition of all nation-states, itself."

 SPR_global_defense_council:0 "Global Defence Council"
 SPR_global_defense_council_desc:1 "Our borders have expanded beyond the geography of the Iberian peninsula, and the title we have given to our temporary defence council is no longer representative for all who are a part of it.

 SPR_arm_the_workers_militias_desc:1 "We have organised militias from the workforce, and must now ensure they are adequately equipped so they may form the vanguard against the fascist enemy and the disloyal army."
 SPR_hinder_nkvd_interference_desc:1 "The Soviet NKVD has been interfering in internal Spanish affairs for too long. Vocal criticisers of Stalin have disappeared, our politicians are isolated, and our efforts to combat the fascists are sometimes opposed more by our supposed allies than by our enemies. Enough is enough. We will fight back against the Stalinists."
 SPR_secularize_the_new_state:0 "Secularise the New State"
 SPR_relocate_the_gold_reserves_desc:1 "Our gold reserves are key in the purchase of war materials from abroad. We must ensure it is stored in a safe location, which unfortunately necessitates moving it abroad."
 SPR_crush_the_revolution_desc:1 "The independent manner in which the anarchist communes have conducted themselves has been a thorn in our side, and, quite frankly, their feeble defences constitute a critical weakness in our frontlines. We are better off without them, and so it is time that this revolution is crushed once and for all."
 SPR_repair_and_expand_the_dockyards_desc:1 "Major dockyards were not immune to the destruction of the civil war. While repairing these, we should look into expanding them as well, so that we are prepared for future naval expansion programmes."
 SPR_expand_the_means_of_production_desc:1 "The health of the collective relies upon the strength of its industry. By expanding ours we can ensure stability within and strengthen our defences against enemies without."

 SPR_nationalize_the_industry:0 "Nationalise the Industry"
 SPR_nationalize_the_industry_desc:1 "Rather than let our industry waste away in the hands of investors and companies, we will place it under control of the state itself, to better direct and organise their production."
 SPR_red_bulwark_in_the_west_desc:1 "Our geographical position is one of isolation from our allies. Should we be attacked, especially by strong naval powers, we will not be able to rely upon aid from [SOV.GetNameDef]. We therefore must make sure that our defences are such that we may act as a bastion of socialism; its western anchor in Europe."
 SPR_appeal_for_increased_autonomy_desc:1 "The price of the [SOV.GetAdjective] aid that made our victory possible has been subservience. We have shown to be loyal and capable defenders of socialism, and certainly this is recognised in Moscow. Perhaps we can convince them to relax the reins."
 SPR_modernize_the_armed_forces:0 "Modernise the Armed Forces"
 SPR_support_french_communists_desc:1 "[FRA.GetNameDefCap] has had a recent history of communist sentiment. Should they see the wisdom in our co-operation in the furthering of the worker's goals then we will join forces, but should they not be so enlightened we must bring socialism to them by force."

 SPR_collectivize_industry_desc:1 "Collectivisation of industry will serve to further improve productivity and worker morale."
 SPR_transplant_soviet_industry_desc:2 "The Soviets have shown themselves particularly adept at the relocation of whole factories, even on a distance of thousands of kilometres. To kickstart our own domestic military industry we will request the transplantation of some of their less important factories to the Iberian peninsula."

 SPR_petition_for_french_aid_desc:1 "Our neighbours to the north hesitate in their desire to lend us aid, cowed by the prospect of internal unrest should they take any action at all. We cannot allow them to remain so indecisive; our very survival depends on their willingness to act."
 SPR_the_popular_army_desc:1 "Our new army will be made up of those untainted by the treachery of the military; those among the population who are zealous in their defence of the principles upon which the Republic is built, but who perhaps did not serve previously. Coupled with this reorganisation we will also develop new arms and doctrines to aid this new army in their fight."

 SPR_navy_modernization:0 "Navy Modernisation"
 SPR_fuel_for_the_war_machine_desc:0 "Resources are of paramount importance to our war industry, and the more self-sufficient we can be in these needs, the better.

 FRA_invest_in_the_colonies_desc:0 "Our industrial heartlands in Europe don't have the population and resources to sustain a large industrial expansion. If our economy is to be competitive with the rest of the world, we must utilise our colonies."

 FRA_battle_of_maneuver:0 "Battle of Manoeuvre"
 FRA_battle_of_maneuver_desc:0 "The old notion of a battlefield as a small area in which armies clash is dead. With mass-motorisation, aeroplanes and fast radio communications, battles move fast over hundreds of kilometers. The sooner we prepare for this, the better."
 FRA_air_dominance_desc:0 "The development of the aeroplane has created a third flank for the army to worry about. We must secure this flank or face catastrophe."
 FRA_air_ground_cooperation:0 "Air-Ground Co-operation"

 FRA_invite_anti_fascist_emigrants_desc:1 "The first step every fascist regime takes is to exile its critics and the people who could present an alternative vision of how the country could be organised. However, these people are also perfectly suited to form a government-in-exile to prepare for the day their country is liberated."
 FRA_host_the_german_exiles_desc:0 "Germany, the home of Marx and Engels, was once at the forefront of communist thought and practice. Many German communists fled when the Nazis took power. If we give them a home, they can help us organise a more effective government of liberated territories."

 FRA_reorganize_the_aviation_industry:0 "Reorganise the Aviation Industry"
 FRA_dirigisme_desc:0 "While the full-on planned economy of the Soviet model is clearly too extreme a measure, a certain measure of planning and direction is needed to optimise our economy."
 FRA_ban_the_leagues_desc:0 "The far-right leagues have been allowed to organise unchecked. While they are currently too weak to try a coup, there is no telling of what they might be able to do in the future. Best to dissolve them now."
 FRA_invest_in_our_weaker_allies_desc:0 "If we are to have capable allies in case of war, we must enable them to meet their own military needs. A programme of moderate investments into their industry will allow them to produce the munitions they need locally."

 FRA_join_the_ententes_desc:1 "France can not sustain two commitments of mutual defence at the same time. Unless we can get the British to agree to honour our commitments as well, we would have to choose. By combining our disparate networks of alliances into a single whole, we increase the deterrence factor of our alliances by an order of magnitude."
 FRA_stimulate_the_dynamic_market_desc:0 "The dynamic market has been proven to be the most efficient form of economic organisation. But it is still run by humans, and human beings sometimes need some reassurances that their hard work will not be in vain. By legislating away some restrictions and giving guarantees, we can help investors overcome their fears and help stimulate our economy."
 FRA_utilize_the_leagues:0 "Utilise the Leagues"
 FRA_the_first_citizen_of_the_state_desc:0 "The king, while imbued with considerable power, must never be seen as a tyrant or absolutist ruler of the old kind. Instead, a modern monarch must respect the law and be the first line of defence against those that would usurp power illegally."
 FRA_the_legitimate_heir_desc:1 "The Legitimists consider the Carlist branch to be the legitimate heir to the throne of France. Appointing their candidate to the throne opens up the tantalising possibility of ruling Spain and France in a double-monarchy."

 FRA_coordinate_rearmament_tt:0 "Reduces the cost of production licences for members of our faction."

There will be detractors, of course, but we must do what is right for the people living in our territories."
