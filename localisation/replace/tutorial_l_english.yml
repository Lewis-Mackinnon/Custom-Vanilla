 HINT_CONSTRUCTIONS_TEXT:0 "This is the §YConstructions§! screen and it is used to improve your States and Provinces by constructing buildings. In the beginning of the game, it is suggested that you build §YCivilian Factories§! for a couple of years before starting to build §YMilitary Factories§! or more specialised structures. By building Civilian Factories you will be able to construct more buildings in the long-term.\n\nAll free Civilian Factories will be constructing new buildings according to their order in the Construction queue.\n\nCivilian Factories have been highlighted for your convenience. §YClick it to activate Build Mode§!. When Build Mode is active, click on the map to queue the construction of a building. §YHold shift and click to queue the maximum amount.§!"
 HINT_EXECUTE_ORDER_TEXT:1 "Below the portrait, there is a small progress bar (3) indicating relative strength between your Army and possible hostile forces.\n\n If you have not assigned a Commander to the Army already, you should probably do so now. Click the empty portrait in the top left.\n\nIf everything is looking good in your favour the estimated plan light (2) should be green. It it is, click the Execute Plan button (1)."
 HINT_NATIONAL_FOCUS_TEXT:0 "This is the §YNational Focus§! screen and it allows your country to select its political goals which will result in effects or bonuses that helps the game progress.\n\nWe have highlighted a couple of National Focusses for your convenience that we recommend that you start with. The reason this path is recommended is because it allows you to gain another §YResearch Slot§! as quickly as possible, which will allow you to research one more £tech_mod  §YTechnology§! simultaneously."
 HINT_POLITICS_SCREEN_TEXT:0 "This is the §YPolitics Screen§! and this is where you can access things like your country's §YNational Focusses§!, £pol_idea §YIdeas§!, §YLaws§! and more.\n\n£pol_power §YPolitical Power§! represents you country's ability to reach its political goals.\nHiring advisers, justifying claims or guaranteeing independence are all examples of actions that require £pol_power Political Power.\n\n£pol_idea Ideas provide your country with bonuses in different areas, but they also cost £pol_power Political Power to activate."
 HINT_RESEARCH_TREE_TEXT:0 "This is the §YResearch Tree§!. Although it might seem overwhelming at first, it is actually not too complicated. We have highlighted some technologies that are recommended to research in the beginning of the game.\n\nIt is a good idea to research technologies that boost your country's industrial base as well as more general military improvements. As the game progresses it might be valid to research more specialised Technologies such as Doctrines or Aircraft. It all depends on what you are trying to achieve.\n\nTechnologies take longer to research if you are trying to research something ahead of time. There are §YNational Focusses§! that can reduce the ahead-of-time penalty for certain Technologies."
 HINT_RESEARCH_SCREEN_TEXT:0 "This is the §YResearch§! screen. You have a number of research slots that each can research a £tech_mod  §YTechnology§!. Click the empty §YResearch Slot§! to select something to Research.\n\nCountries have a different amount of Research Slots, with Major Powers usually having more. It is possible to unlock an additional slot through §YNational Focusses§!. National Focusses will be covered by another alert and another hint."
 HINT_WORLD_TENSION_TEXT:0 "This is the £world_tension_icon  §YWorld Tension§! screen. All events that affect the World Tension somehow, will be shown in the list here.\n\nWorld Tension is a measurement of how heated the game has become. Certain countries may have certain §YDiplomatic Actions§! locked until World Tension is high enough.\n\nGenerally speaking, Axis powers want the World Tension to stay low to prevent Democratic countries from intervening, while Democratic countries want World Tension to be high so that they can intervene.\n\nDeclaring War, justifying claims, annexing territory, completing certain §YNational Focusses§! are all examples of action that might increase World Tension.\n\nThe higher the World Tension is, the closer you are to a World War."
