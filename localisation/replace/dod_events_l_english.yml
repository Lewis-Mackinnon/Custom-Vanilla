 DOD_hungary.20.desc:0 "Following the outbreak of war in Hungary, the question of supporting them has come up repeatedly. Conservative newspapers have clamoured for action to help the Hungarians, claiming that the King can not reasonably be expected to sit idle while his own son, now the King of Hungary, is under attack. A letter by an anonymous group of Army officers has been leaked to the press, stating that a large number of soldiers would be willing to go to Hungary to fight, if the government would let them. \n\nThe government has met to discuss a number of options."
 DOD_hungary.21.desc:0 "Despite multiple appeals from both the Swedish king and elements of the Swedish military, the government of Sweden has refused to allow anyone to come to our aid. Even private individuals who wish to travel to Hungary to fight are refused travelling visas, and the government has pushed through legislation making it illegal to sell guns to us."
 DOD_hungary.23.desc:0 "In a development surprising even experienced diplomats, the Swedish government has announced that they consider our survival to be a core national interest of Sweden. Rumour has it that the Swedish King himself has intervened on our behalf, threatening to abdicate and travel to Hungary in person to offer his service in the army unless the government offered something more than warm words of support."
 DOD_hungary.26.desc:0 "Hungary has opened their old arsenals and sent us a number of refurbished rifles and other infantry equipment. Several thousand Hungarian volunteers have also made their way to us."
 DOD_hungary.27.desc:0 "The Hungarian government has issued a statement proclaiming that any attack on Sweden is to be considered an attack on Hungary as well. The Hungarian Military has been placed at high alert and is expected to enter the war as soon as mobilisation is complete."
 DOD_hungary.30.desc:0 "The Hungarian government has approached us with the offer to renegotiate the Treaty of Trianon. Under their offer, the restrictions on army size in the treaty would be changed to allow Hungary to bring its current army to full strength. Hungary would further be permitted to spend a greater portion of its budget on expanding and modernising its military industries. \n\nWith a democratic government firmly in charge of the country, there is considerable support for the scheme in our diplomatic service."
 DOD_hungary.33.desc:0 "Hungary has recently started to feel out its neighbours about revising some of the restrictions placed on it after the last war. Specifically, they want to reintroduce conscription and expand their military industries. The Hungarian argument is that the world is becoming less safe with every passing day, and that they need a proper military to defend themselves. [From.From.GetNameDefCap] thinks otherwise."
 DOD_hungary.40.desc:0 "[HUN.GetLeader] today publicly stated that he no longer considers [HUN.GetNameDef] bound by the treaty. More than that, he declared it null and void, claiming that it was forced on Hungary at gun point and therefore never legally binding. The Hungarian government has not even bothered to formally inform us of their decision.\n\n Many in the government favour a strong reply. If we show the Hungarians that we are not afraid of them, they will surely fold. However, they might also decide that we are bluffing."
 DOD_hungary.41.desc:0 "Our recent decision to abandon the Treaty of Trianon has been met with a surprisingly strong rebuttal by [From.GetNameDef]. [From.GetLeader] reportedly demanded that the [From.GetAdjective] military prepare a plan for intervention at once. Meanwhile, the [From.GetAdjective] ambassador has asked that we clarify our statements regarding the Treaty, suggesting that the military option is still on the table."
 DOD_hungary.43.desc:0 "It appears that our warning to Hungary has fallen on deaf ears. At a rally in Budapest last evening, the crowds reportedly shouted "Death to [From.From.GetNameDef]!" and [HUN.GetLeader] publicly vowed that any attempt to stop Hungary from reclaiming its rightful place in the world would be met with "a war the likes the world has never seen, a war that will make the great slaughter of 1914 to 1918 look like a mere bar fight".\n\nWe are at a crossroads. We must either go to war to defend our honour and credibility, or accept that we have been outmanoeuvred."
 DOD_hungary.52.desc:0 "It is perhaps most telling that the Romanian ambassador, in a meeting with [HUN.GetLeader] this morning, felt the need to add "as always" to his flat refusal to even discuss the possibility of transferring the contested territories. Time and again, the Romanian government has publicly refused our claims, even ridiculing them. For years, we were too weak to push back.\n\nNot anymore."

 DOD_hungary.54.a:0 "This is spiralling out of control."
 DOD_hungary.55.f:1 "There is no-one willing to hear our case..."
 DOD_hungary.60.desc:0 "Over the last few days, the tense relations between Hungary and Romania have broken down completely. Hungary has demanded Romania turn over the contested territories of Transylvania to them. Romania has refused. Both sides have now mobilised their forces, and war in the region seems inevitable.\n\nThe Foreign Office believes it to be imperative that we prepare an intervention to defend our interests in the region. there is also a chance that the mere threat of us getting involved will bring the other side to the negotiation table."
 DOD_hungary.65.desc:0 "When informed of the results of the arbitration on the disputed territories, [HUN.GetLeader] refused to accept them. According to him, anything less than the full restoration of the old borders of Hungary would be considered an insult to every Hungarian alive or dead.\n\nHe went even further, saying that the time for negotiations and diplomacy had passed, and that there was only one way that this issue could now be settled. \n\nThe Romanian government has asked where we stand in this dispute, considering that we have agreed to support them previously."
 DOD_hungary.67.desc:0 "Negotiations between the Great Powers have broken down completely, as the two nations have been unable to find any common ground. Any attempt at a compromise solution has been derailed by mutually unacceptable demands. The delegations have travelled back to their home countries, leaving the matter unresolved."
 DOD_hungary.73.desc:0 "Having decided to reject the Hungarian offer, it is now up to us to offer different terms."
 DOD_hungary.82.desc:0 "The ambassador from [CZE.GetName] has come to us with an urgent request for help. Recently, [HUN.GetNameDef] has launched a major destabilisation campaign aimed at southern Slovakia. Their goal is clear - they want to create a pretext for an invasion to protect people they consider their citizens. \n\nThe [CZE.GetAdjective] government has asked for our support in the matter."
 DOD_hungary.86.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has declined our request to back us up in the face of blatant Hungarian agression. While they are sympathetic to our cause, they are not willing to risk blood or treasure for its defence."
 DOD_hungary.92.desc:0 "In a tense meeting with [YUG.GetLeader], our delegation was told that the sovereignty of the Vojvodina was not up for discussion, and that in any event the [YUG.GetAdjective] government would never bow to such pressure. The people of the Vojvodina had their say in 1919, and they choose to stay with [YUG.GetNameDef]. As far as the [YUG.GetAdjective] government is concerned, that is the end of the matter."
 DOD_hungary.95.desc:0 "\nAfter several rounds of negotiations, no agreement has been reached with the [From.GetAdjective] government on the issue of reorganising Yugoslavia. A note signed by [From.GetLeader] himself states that any outstanding territorial issues would be solved on a bilateral basis, "when the situation calls for it.""
 DOD_hungary.96.desc_HUN_GER:0 "Instead of defusing the situation, our strong response to the latest Hungarian demands concerning the Vojvodina have apparently led to a pact between Hungary and Germany. In a recent speech, [GER.GetLeader] called Slovenia "one of the old, unredeemed provinces of the Reich" that should be reclaimed as soon as possible. The Hungarian and the German ambassador have both handed over a note to the effect that the Vojvodina and Slovenia are to be transferred to their control at once."
 DOD_hungary.96.desc_HUN_ITA:0 "Instead of defusing the situation, our strong response to the latest Hungarian demands concerning the Vojvodina have apparently led to a pact between Hungary and Italy. In a recent speech, [ITA.GetLeader] referred to Dalmatia as "the unredeemed far shore of the Adriatic". The Hungarian and the Italian ambassador have both handed over a note to the effect that the Vojvodina and Dalmatia are to be transferred to their control at once."
 DOD_hungary.96.desc_HUN_both:0 "Our refusal to bow to Hungarian demands have not led to a change of heart in Budapest. The angry rhetoric coming out of the Hungarian capital is now matched by equally disturbing statements from Rome and Berlin. Both nations have expressed support for the Hungarian position, while at the same time announcing their own set of demands. The ambassadors from the three countries have appeared together at the Foreign office to formally hand over a note demanding that the Vojvodina, Slovenia and Dalmatia be transferred to their respective claimants."
 DOD_hungary.100.desc:0 "The Hungarian government has approached us about the future status of Slovakia. They strongly believe that they should have full control over the fate of Slovakia, seeing how Slovakia used to be part of Hungary during the days of the Empire.\n\nWhile the Hungarian delegation shied away from issuing any explicit threats, our intelligence service reports an unsettling amount of activity inside the Hungarian military."
 DOD_hungary.101.t:0 "Slovakia transferred"
 DOD_hungary.101.desc:0 "Slovakia has returned to our control. The question is now how we should organise it. While many in the government favour outright annexation, calling it the "Return to the historical borders", some others are worried about the effect of trying to integrate so many non-Hungarians into our state. Their preferred option would be to set up a devolved government in Bratislava, with some powers over their internal policies, but closely aligned to us in all other matters."
 DOD_hungary.103.desc:0 "The Hungarian government has approached us with an offer to divide [CZE.GetNameDef]. We would get the western parts of the country, while Hungary would get most of Slovakia, with the demarcation line between our countries roughly bisecting the country. \n\nThey have assured us that as long as they get their share in the end, they are willing to let us make the first move."
 germany.55.do:0 "Honour the promise to Hungary."
 DOD_hungary.106.desc:0 "Despite the written promise of [From.GetLeader], the German government has not honoured their commitments to us. In the recent negotiations about the fate of [CZE.GetNameDef], we have played no role except as a tool to pressure others into compliance. It appears that [From.GetLeader] never intended to keep his word."
 DOD_hungary.106.b:0 "Mobilise the Army."
 DOD_hungary.107.desc_SLO_independent:0 "Following several weeks of feverish activity in the Hungarian military, [HUN.GetLeader] has issued a proclamation, declaring that the current situation in Slovakia is a grave concern for Hungary, and demanding certain guarantees from us. \n\nAmongst other things, we would have to consult them before we enter any alliances or sign any treaties and would need to accept a military mission to co-ordinate our military."
 DOD_hungary.114.a:0 "The revolution marches ever onwards."
 DOD_hungary.118.a:0 "We would love to see them try."
 DOD_hungary.120.desc:0 "[HUN.GetLeader] has travelled to Moscow, bearing a proposal to offer a joint guarantee to [CZE.GetNameDef] in return for lifting restrictions on the Communist party and transfer of sovereignty of southern Slovakia to Hungary."
 DOD_hungary.122.desc:0 "Our offer of a guarantee has not been met with much enthusiasm by the [CZE.GetAdjective]s. The political concessions we asked for have caused an uproar in [CZE.GetNameDef], with several prominent Generals and political figures threatening to resign if the government accepts.\n\nCiting grave concerns that support could reach them in time, the [CZE.GetAdjective] government has officially declined our offer."
 DOD_hungary.124.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Foreign Minister has arrived in Berlin to discuss a scheme to divide [CZE.GetNameDef] into two parts. Each party of the proposed treaty would have full control over their part of the territory. Naturally, we would be getting the western parts of Bohemia and Moravia, while they would get Slovakia."
 DOD_hungary.124.b:0 "We will not tolerate their meddling in our neighbourhood!"
 DOD_hungary.126.desc:0 "The [CZE.GetAdjective] government has reportedly refused the offer of a guarantee, on account of the 'unbearable' concessions asked in return.\n\nHowever, our ambassador to [SOV.GetNameDef] reports that there is heavy activity in the [SOV.GetAdjective] foreign ministry. Rumours in diplomatic circles point towards a possible deal with Germany."
 DOD_hungary.129.desc:0 "The German ambassador has today handed over a note from [GER.GetLeader], demanding the immediate transfer of governmental powers to him as the new "Reichsprotektor", pending the arrival of a specifically chosen administrator from Berlin. In the same note, the ambassador demanded that [From.From.GetNameDef] be given similar rights with regards to Slovakia.\n\nShould we refuse, the note promises "swift and decisive military action.""
 DOD_hungary.140.desc:0 "Citing the ever worsening political situation in Europe and the complete failure of the League of Nations to stop this, [HUN.GetLeader] has publicly announced that his government will seek to secure the support of neighbouring nations to allow for a revision of the Treaty of Trianon. Without mentioning any territorial claims, [HUN.GetLeader] discussed only the restrictions on the Hungarian military.\n\nA delegation from Hungary has arrived in our capital to secure our formal agreement to Hungarian re-armament."
 DOD_hungary.142.desc:0 "We have managed to secure [From.GetAdjective] support for a partial revision of the Treaty of Trianon. All restrictions on our military have been removed. The international arms inspectors have left the country, and the war ministry has drawn up initial plans for a modest expansion of our armed forces."
 DOD_hungary.143.desc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] ambassador has transmitted the following note: \n"The Government of [From.GetNameDef] is watching the recent developments in [HUN.GetNameDef] with grave concern. The Treaty of Trianon has long been a guarantee for peace and stability in the region. While the [From.GetAdjective] government accepts, in principle, that nations should be permitted to choose their own destiny, we must urge the government of [HUN.GetNameDef] in the strongest possible terms to abide by the treaty. The consequences of destabilising the region any further could very quickly become uncontrollable.""
 DOD_hungary.146.desc:0 "The Hungarian government is currently attempting to alter the Treaty of Trianon to allow Hungary to begin rebuilding her military. The negotiations in Bled have been stalled for several days now. The Hungarian ambassador has approached our government with a request to exert diplomatic pressure on the other side.\n\nThe Foreign Office cautions that siding with Hungary would no doubt negatively impact relations with her neighbours and shift the balance of power in the area. However, denying the Hungarians might cause them to make an aggressive move and abandon diplomacy altogether, which could destabilise the entire region."
 DOD_hungary.150.desc:0 "A recent study of modern air combat has shown a critical weakness in our air force. Our fighters are severely behind developments in other countries. The Air Ministry has initiated a crash program to acquire a modern fighter as soon as feasible. Since domestic development would take an unacceptable amount of time, it has been decided to purchase a licence from abroad. An additional budget has been authorised.\n\nExperts differ on what type of plane would be best suited to modernise our fighter wings."
