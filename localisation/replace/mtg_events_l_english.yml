 mexico.2.title:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Oil Nationalised"
 mexico.2.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] has been stirring up populist nonsense aimed against our economic interests in Mexico, and now the [From.GetRulingPartyLong] has passed legislation to nationalise the assets of Royal Dutch Shell, Standard Oil of California, and many other international oil firms! Although their Constitution allows this action, international justice demands compensation for the losses suffered by the firms. The oil barons are demanding we act."
 mexico.3.desc:0 "In response to our nationalisation of their oil concessions, [From.GetLeader] has decided to accept the demands of the oil companies and has placed an embargo on our country. [From.GetNameDef] will no longer buy or sell resources with us. We should consider either compensating the oil firms, or abandoning the international status quo and seeking our fortunes with the enemies of liberal capitalism."
 mexico.4.desc:0 "The government of [From.GetLeader] has agreed to demands from Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil of California for compensation in exchange for the losses sustained by the firms during nationalisation of the oil fields. [From.GetNameDef] will not give back any oil concessions, but our national prestige and financial interests are at least sated."
 mexico.16.desc:0 "The oil workers unionised in 1935 with the blessing of President Cárdenas, creating the Sindicato Único de Trabajadores Petroleros. They immediately began trying to negotiate higher wages and better working conditions, but were rebuffed by the powerful international oil firms like Royal Dutch Shell and Standard Oil of California. The matter passed to an arbitration committee and eventually went to the courts, with the burning question being whether the oil firms could afford the higher wages.\n\nAccording to recent investigations, the Mexican subsidiaries make even more profit than oil companies in the United States, but still refuse to come to an agreement with the workers. It seems they have the backing of powerful regional strongmen and see themselves as being above the law."
 mexico.17.c:0 "He's an organisational genius, invite him to join the government."
 mexico.20.desc:0 "Right-wing businessman and Revolutionary general Juan Andreu Almazán has denounced the outcome of the recent election. He claims his support was greater and that [Root.GetLeader] only won thanks to manipulating the outcome. While this might be true, Juan Andreu is certainly acting like a sore loser. He has gone into self-imposed exile in America and is trying to organise a coup attempt against the [Root.GetRulingPartyLong]. Remaining on good terms with America would be prudent."
 mexico.23.desc:0 "With enemy convoy protection stretched thin and our submarines prowling the oceans unmolested, we are able to destroy isolated merchant vessels almost at will. Our submarine captains have taken to calling these 'the Happy Times'. There are many tantalising targets to choose from, such as neutral Mexican oil tankers. Our admirals request permission to engage these tankers, although the foreign office warns it could have negative consequences on relations with Mexico."
 mexico.28.desc:0 "Our attacks on the treacherous Church have evidently not been carried out with enough vigour. The traitors have been busy using the freedom we gave them to organise a coup attempt. Recalling the futile Cristero War we justly defeated many years ago, these superstitious fools have raised their crucifix banners and rallied behind the lying priests and are now seeking to undo the progress we have been making towards modernisation."
 mexico.32.desc:0 "Hispanic youths wearing extravagent clothes - 'zoot suits' - have been the target of racialised riots in border cities in the South, stemming from sensationalised reporting over the death of a teenager in Los Angeles. Nine Mexican-American youths have been convicted for murder over the incident.\n\nIntelligence agents have compiled reports stating that the zoot suiters are in fact fascist agents, collaborating with ultra-Catholic Sinarquistas in Mexico in order to assist in a Japanese-German invasion of the Americas."
 mexico.33.desc:0 "Hispanic youths wearing extravagent clothes - 'zoot suits' - have been the target of racialised riots in border cities to our North, stemming from sensationalised reporting over the death of a teenager in Los Angeles. Nine Mexican-American youths have been convicted for murder over the incident.\n\nAmerican intelligence agents have compiled reports stating that the zoot suiters are in fact fascist agents, collaborating with ultra-Catholic Sinarquistas in Mexico in order to assist in a Japanese-German invasion of the Americas."
 mexico.35.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] has agreed to grant us licences for the latest German light and medium tank designs. This will hopefully serve as the first stage of closer Mexican-German relations as well as being useful military knowledge."
 mexico.36.desc:0 "Citing the possibility of Germany's advanced tank designs falling into enemy hands, [From.GetLeader] has refused our offer of a resource exchange. We will have to develop native tank designs, or pay the Germans for their licences..."
 mexico.40.desc:0 "Our surprise assault on the Yanqui base in Panamá has succeeded. We have driven out the imperialists and now await the response of the decrepit Northern empire. If they choose to throw themselves at our defences, we will make them pay."
 mexico.42.desc:0 "Our surprise assault on the Yanqui base in Panamá has gone awry. Perhaps we did not deploy enough troops, or the commander was simply incompetent. Either way, we have been driven out by the imperialists and now await the response of the decrepit Northern empire. If they choose to throw themselves at our defences, we will make them pay."
 mexico.44.desc1:0 "Following a [From.GetAdjective] incursion into the American military base at the Panamá Canal, troops on both sides of the border have been mobilising for war. Though the Mexicans struck first, seizing the strategically important Canal Zone, the Americans seem to be the ones aiming to launch an offensive to punish their insolent neighbour. The 'gutter press' is denouncing the [From.GetRulingPartyLong] as a clique of bandits with no respect for international law, and calling for regime change.\n\nIf a Second Mexican-American War breaks out, it would be fought in the harsh and unforgiving terrain of mountains and deserts, with much greater loss of life than the small scuffle in 1847 which preceded the Mexican Cession."
 mexico.44.desc2:0 "Reports of [From.GetAdjective] troops entering the American military base at the Panamá Canal have been confirmed by [From.GetLeader], who claims to have been acting to preserve [From.GetAdjective] interests in Centroamérica following domestic turbulence in the United States. The [From.GetRulingPartyLong] propaganda ministry has requested that all remaining American soldiers in the area give up their arms and respect the 'peaceful handover of power' in the Canal Zone. The American president has been heavily criticised by the 'gutter press' for not fighting harder to preserve national interests in the area, and for failing to follow up the [From.GetAdjective] attack with a general mobilisation against [From.GetNameDef]."
 mexico.45.desc1:0 "American troops on the Southern border have been placed on high alert, as recent [From.GetAdjective] aggression against the American military base at the Panamá Canal raises the possibility of a large scale war between the two neighbours. Though [From.GetLeader]'s surprise attack failed, the American president has reportedly decided to punish the insolent Southern neighbour. The 'gutter press' is denouncing the [From.GetRulingPartyLong] as a clique of bandits with no respect for international law, and calling for regime change.\n\nIf a Second Mexican-American War breaks out, it would be fought in the harsh and unforgiving terrain of mountains and deserts, with much greater loss of life than the small scuffle in 1847 which preceded the Mexican Cession."
 mexico.53.desc:1 "We long believed our current leaders to spread the true interpretation of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, but now they have been forced to undergo 'self-criticism' and publicly confess that the Trotskyist interpretation of Lenin is the only correct path towards the triumph of Socialism. As a result, we suddenly find ourselves isolated. Our alliance has collapsed and we are facing a Cornelian dilemna: recognise the rightfulness of Trotskyist views or become isolated and at odds with the [MEX.GetFactionName]."
 mexico.54.desc:1 "In a passionate speech lasting more than 4 hours, [MEX.GetLeader] demanded that we abandon all our colonies in the Caribbean area as they are according to him "The most visible proofs of our imperialist oppression over the region". While some argue that we cannot afford to anger Mexico at the moment, more resolute advisers emphasise that we are totally capable of resisting them and that our territorial integrity should never be jeopardised."
 mexico.55.desc:0 "Put face to face with its Imperialist contradictions, the [From.GetAdjective] government has decolonised from its Caribbean possessions. This is a great day for the workers but the struggle is far from over. The process has not resulted in the total freedom of the workers as they are still subject of oppressive institutions."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.1.desc:1 "Led and organised by the Silver Legion of America, a number of centrist and right-wing organisations today marched through the capital in one of the largest demostrations Washington has seen so far. Other gatherings have been reported all across the country.\n\nThe march ended in front of the Capitol, where the crowd demanded that "Communists in Congress assembled" were delivered to them to stand trial before a "People's Grand Jury" for treason against the United States.\n\nPrivately, some members of the administration share some of the protesters' more legitimate concerns about the rule of law and adherence to constitutional checks and balances. Others, however, suggest a hard line against them. With more demonstrations planned for the coming weeks, we must chose quickly."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.10.t:1 "Armoury Raided"
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.10.desc:1 "A US Army armoury in [GetCSAState] was assaulted and briefly taken over yesterday. The small detachment of guards found themselves opposed by a large armed mob that demanded the keys to the storage rooms. When reinforcements from a nearby garrison arrived, the attackers had already retreated, carrying with them a large number of small arms.\n\nGiven that the guards were completely unharmed and the reinforcements took a suspiciously long time to arrive, some in government speculate that this was a co-ordinated attack."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.13.t:1 "Governor mobilises National Guard"
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.13.desc:1 "The Governor of [usa_ng_mobilized.GetName] has announced that he has mobilised the state's National Guard for what he called "an extended period of training and exercises". The war department claims it has no knowledge of any planned manoeuvres in [usa_ng_mobilized.GetName]. \n\n It also appears that the National Guard units took their full allotment of supplies and live ammunition with them when they marched out, raising questions about just what they are preparing for."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.20.desc:1 "At 8:00 AM today, a special envoy from [CSAcapital.GetName] arrived at the White House to deliver to President [USA.GetLeader] a note from the State Legislation announcing that [CSAcapital.GetName] will no longer consider itself part of the republic. Claiming that this is a fundamental right of any civilised people - and quoting extensively from the Declaration of Independence - the note also stated emphatically that a peaceful secession is in everyone's interest and that the new state wishes nothing more than to conduct its own affairs as a good neighbour of [USA.GetNameDef]."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.21.desc:1 "Mere hours after the first state severed its ties with [USA.GetNameDef], others followed suit with almost identically sounding declarations. Hopes of a peaceful separation were quickly dashed when several demonstrations in the affected states in favour of continued membership in [USA.GetNameDef] turned bloody and a number of federal officials were assaulted. In a few cases, supporters of President [USA.GetLeader] - or just people accused of insufficient zeal for independence - were lynched by the crowd. Interim President [CSA.GetLeader] has called these events "regrettable but understandable acts of civic retaliation against governmental overreach", and promised the perpetrators presidential pardons if they came forward.\n\n He further demanded a complete withdrawal of all federal troops from the territory of the new state as well as a demilitarised zone at the border to avoid "further misunderstandings". President [USA.GetLeader] has refused to even entertain the notion and ordered the military to restore order in the states in rebellion."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.201.desc:0 "As our forces have advanced into [CSA_liberated_state.GetName], they have come across a large number of sympathetic citizens who have long harboured hidden sympathies towards us. Swept up in a wave of patriotic fervour, they have asked to join our military."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_fascists.202.desc:0 "As our forces have advanced into [USA_liberated_state.GetName], they have come across a large number of sympathetic citizens who have long harboured hidden sympathies towards us. Swept up in a wave of patriotic fervour, they have asked to join our military."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.1.desc:1 "Another wave of mass-protests has hit the capital, with demonstrations clogging every major road in and around the Capitol Building. Organised by the "Action Committee for the Preservation of the Republic", the protesters demanded an independent investigation into allegations of corruption and misconduct in the administration of President [USA.GetLeader]. In particular, they demanded that the President denounce the Silver Legion and publicly assure them that their rights as voters will be respected.\n\nPresident [USA.GetLeader] has refused to comment on the issue."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.2.desc:1 "All across the country, the regular protests against the policies of President [USA.GetLeader] have only grown in size, now regularly topping several million protesters. Today, More than a million marched through the streets of Washington, with similar numbers reported in at least nine other locations. This is not even accounting for the smaller marches in state capitals and smaller cities, which still pulled in thousands of people each, with some topping hundreds of thousands. The protests come after a series of unpopular policy decisions by the administration, which the organisers claim undermine the very democratic fabric of the republic.\n\n Where previously the protesters demanded that the President distance himself from more radical ideologies, they have now come to demand his immediate removal from office."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.10.desc:1 "A US armoury in a remote part of [GETUSASTATE] was subjected to an assault by forces unknown over the last night. The small group of armed men forced the few guards into a shed, where they were locked in. When the soldiers managed to escape after dawn, they found the armoury thoroughly looted. It appears that during the night, the attackers moved away large quantities of materiel to an unknown location."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.16.desc:1 "After decades of migration away from the rural areas towards industrial centres in the north-east, recent government reports have shown a dramatic reversal. More and more companies in the civilian sector are moving to the southern states and settling down in previously under-developed regions, bringing hundreds of new jobs with them. Many factory owners cite the "hostile" climate in the north, wracked with regular strikes and increasingly aggressive unions, as one of the causes."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.20.desc:1 "The series of protests against the President have at last reached a climax. Yesterday, after the march had reached its destination in the center of Boston, the protesters did not disperse to go home. Instead, they broke into smaller groups and seized vital locations around the city. By nightfall, they had full control of the city. The police have largely gone over to the protesters, and the governor of Massachusetts has refused to send in the National Guard.\n\nA "Boston Citizen Committee" has taken over control of the city and is reportedly co-operating with the rebels. Other states in New England have passed motions of support, stating that they no longer consider themselves bound by any law signed by President [USA.GetLeader]. Instead, they call on all other state governments in the United States to declare the President deposed, Congress dissolved and to hold new elections.\n\nWhile parts of the military remain on our side, entire formations have informed their officers that they would not obey orders to crush the rebellion."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.21.a:1 "We still hold the centre of the country."
  mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.22.desc:1 "With more and more states refusing to follow directions from the legitimate government, the governors of Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan have jointly declared that they will not tolerate any seditious behaviour amongst their population. A new civil war, they argue, would leave the US dangerously weakened in the face of foreign aggression."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.29.desc:1 "The state governments of the Dakotas, Iowa, Minnesota and Nebraska were swept out of office by a well co-ordinated and executed uprising supported by local law-enforcement officers and sympathetic national guardsmen. The hastily elected Interim Governors have declared their support for the Boston Government."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.40.desc:0 "With the government in full retreat and large parts of the country siding with the insurrection, General MacArthur has approached us with an offer. Pointing out that only he truly understands the American mindset and provide stability and leadership in this moment of crisis, MacArthur has offered to lead a 'Government of National Defence' until the insurrection has been defeated. According to MacArthur, this is to reduce friction between the civilian leadership and the military commanders by placing General MacArthur in charge.\n\nSome in the government are somewhat uncomfortable with the fact that he continues to refer to himself in the third person."
 mtg_usa_civil_war_democrats.41.desc:0 "With the Boston insurrection finally at an end, many in the government are unsure how to proceed. MacArthur's Government of National Defence was originally envisioned to only last until the end of the war. However, the world around [USA.GetNameDef] has only grown more hostile, and we may soon find ourselves once again at war. Fascist leader William Dudley Pelley has publicly called for a return to 'lawful and orderly government', while thanking MacArthur for his service. Pointing to the surge in support for his movement during the war, Pelley clearly considers himself predestined for the position of President and Leader of America.[USA.GetCandidatesFascism2][USA.GetCandidatesFascism]\n\nIn an uncharacteristic show of humility, [USA.GetLeader] has offered to step down should the public opinion demand it. The American people look to us to see how the rest of the administration considers the issue."
 mtg_usa_canadian_corridor.1.desc:1 "Our ambassador in [USA.GetNameDef] was summoned to the Department of State today and presented with an ultimatum. According to the note handed to him, government of [USA.GetNameDef] can no longer accept Canadian sovereignty over the areas between Washington and Alaska. \n\nSuggestions to negotiate a treaty allowing passage of troops and exemption from certain border controls were flatly refused. The [USA.GetAdjective] government expects an answer by midnight."

 mtg_usa_north_american_dominion.3.desc:1 "[From.GetLeader] has reacted with deep consternation to our diplomatic note. In his answer, he declared that [From.GetNameDef] has a long and proud history of independence and sovereignty and would never permit a foreign power to enforce its will on them.\n\nHe further implored President [USA.GetLeader] to consider the ramifications of a war on this issue, which would surely see [USA.GetNameDef] labeled the largest threat to peace and would have unimaginable consequences."

 mtg_usa_pacific_pacification.1.desc_a:0 "A delegation of the [USA.GetAdjective] government has arrived to discuss the security of our holdings in the Pacific. Noting the continued instability in China and the situation in Japan, President [USA.GetLeader] is willing to assume responsibility for the defence of [GET_AUSTRALIA_NEW_ZEALAND_STATUS], in return for a number of privileges and reserve rights.\n\n While the [USA.GetAdjective]s claim that these rights would only be used to ensure the security of [GET_AUSTRALIA_NEW_ZEALAND_STATUS], many in the government believe that it would make [GET_AUSTRALIA_NEW_ZEALAND_STATUS] little more than puppets."
 mtg_usa_pacific_pacification.1.desc_b:0 "A delegation of the [USA.GetAdjective] government has arrived to discuss plans for our common defence. It appears that President [USA.GetLeader] considers our little part of the world of vital interest to the security of [USA.GetNameDef]. Beyond a simple guarantee to come to our aid, however, the [USA.GetAdjective] government wants to ensure that we ourselves can not become a threat. For this reason, the agreement comes with a number of provisions that will allow [USA.GetNameDef] a significant say in how we conduct our internal matters.\n\nWhile the threat of war has not been made in the negotiations so far, it clear that President [USA.GetLeader] would consider our refusal a very hostile act."
 mtg_usa_pacific_pacification.2.desc:1 "The government of [From.GetLeader] has accepted our proposals. A special joint committee has been set up to co-ordinate the implementation of the details."
 mtg_usa_pacific_pacification.3.desc:1 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has refused to even meet with our delegation, claiming that there are no outstanding issues between our nations. However, the military attaches in [GET_AUSTRALIA_NEW_ZEALAND_STATUS] have reported a significant increase in military manoeuvres recently."
 mtg_usa_secure_asia.5.desc:1 "Speaking before the press, [From.GetLeader] today announced that his government had signed a treaty with [USA.GetNameDef] regarding shared sovereignty in the East Indies.\n\nThe treaty contains a number of secret provisions that will essentially transfer control to us as soon as our administrators are in place. The State Department has already dispatched a number of officials to the region."
 mtg_usa_secure_asia.7.desc:1 "As part of a larger diplomatic offensive, President [USA.GetLeader] has publicly identified Vietnam and Indochina as a region of vital interest to [USA.GetNameDef]. Therefore, [USA.GetNameDef] will aim to increase their presence in the area.\n\nPrivately, [USA.GetNameDef] have been making very aggressive noises about Indochina. Aside from exerting pressure on [SIA.GetNameDef], they have also demanded the right to station troops in our colonies and to 'direct' the colonial administration. \n\nIn effect, this would amount to ceding those territories to their control."

 mtg_usa_protect_south_america.1.desc:1 "At a summit in the [USA.GetAdjective] capital, [USA.GetAdjective] President [USA.GetLeader] has called for a new security architecture in South America. While couched in diplomatic terms, the [USA.GetAdjective] government clearly envisions itself as the main force behind the security of the continent, and in return expects that we follow their political guidance.\n\n In fact, [USA.GetAdjective] diplomats are already pushing for this behind the scenes and translating these proposals into concrete action points like special consultation rights and veto powers for the US ambassador - and only the US ambassador.\n\nMore chilling is the fact that refusing to accept this would, according to the President, be considered a hostile and destabilising act, with 'deeply unfortunate' consequences."

 mtg_usa_foreign_support.6.desc:1 "Our attempts at procuring new weapons from [From.GetNameDef] have been rudely rebuffed. [From.GetLeader] declared that his government would never permit the resources of the [From.GetAdjective] people to be squandered in such stupid endeavours."
 mtg_usa_foreign_support.8.desc:1 "Our agent in [From.GetNameDef] reports a stunning success. Over a private dinner, [From.GetLeader] agreed to sell us a number of armoured vehicles on credit. [From.GetNameDefCap] is watching developments in [USA.GetNameDef] with great interest, and would be more than happy to assist us in any way they can.\n\nHowever, the [From.GetAdjective] government can not be seen to overtly support a party that is not yet in power, so the tanks will be delivered when the war breaks out."
 mtg_usa_foreign_support.13.desc:1 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has approved a small number of Silver Legionnaries for pilot training. Further negotiations have secured the sale of a small number of fighter planes on credit, to be delivered when the war breaks out."

 mtg_news.3.desc:0 "With tensions rising around the globe, the US Congress has been the scene of intense discussions about the role [USA.GetNameDef] should play on the world stage. Many members are concerned that President [USA.GetLeader] might secretly be planning to intervene in a European or Asian war. Some still remember the role the country played in the Great War and are anxious to keep [USA.GetNameDef] out of foreign entanglements.\n\nEager to shore up support for his proposed programmes of economic reform, President [USA.GetLeader] has signed the Neutrality Act into law, which places heavy restrictions on trade with nations at war and specifically prohibits the President from offering any kind of support to other nations."
 mtg_news.5.desc:0 "Following a vote by standing proclamation in the Senate chamber, President [USA.GetLeader] immediately signed the War Powers Act into law. The Act gives the office of the President far greater discretion in the use of the military than previously possible. The President may now deploy troops to defend [USA.GetAdjective] interests whenever and wherever he deems it necessary, for an unlimited duration.\n\nWhile President [USA.GetLeader] claimed that these new powers would only be used under the most dire of circumstances, sources inside the State department claim that it is merely the first step in a large-scale programme of reshaping the global balance of power."
