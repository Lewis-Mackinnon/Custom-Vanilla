 military_youth_desc:0 "Organisations to promote discipline and political education of young people in our nation will foster loyalty and self-sacrifice early."
 deterrence_desc:0 "Standing alone, we rarely benefit from war. Fortunately, we know that the best defence is one so well-known you never have to put it to use."
 paramilitarism_desc:0 "Military principles have applications outside of the military. With the development of semi-militarised units to complement our armed forces, more people will have military training."
 GER_west_wall_desc:0 "The Westwall runs parallel to France's vaunted Maginot Line, occupying much of the same ground as the Siegfried Line did in the previous Weltkrieg. Fortifying its defences will allow us to hold the border with fewer men, freeing up divisions to participate in any potential eastern campaigns."
 GER_west_wall_tt:0 "§RIf the Rhineland is remilitarised, you will also gain:§!\n"
 GER_army_innovation_desc:1 "Heinz Guderian and other radical theorists are pushing for daring new doctrines emphasising communication, identification of 'schwerpunkte' and local concentrations of combined arms forces. Giving them free reins might help avoid the meat grinder horrors of the Great War."
 GER_soviet_treaty_desc:0 "We can pursue a new research treaty with the Soviet Union in order to develop, chiefly, better tanks. If they agree, we can reopen the tank school we closed down in Kama in 1933. Soviet co-operation will, of course, mean that they too will benefit from the innovations made..."
 GER_soviet_ally_desc:0 "Perhaps it is possible to put aside our ideological differences with the Soviets and instead emphasise what unites us: hatred of selfish liberalism and the decadent West. With the USSR as an ally, we would have access to all the resources we need - in addition to their military power, of course..."
 GER_rhineland_desc:0 "The Rhineland has been demilitarised since the end of the Great War, but this insult shall stand no longer! Germany is a sovereign nation and is free to move troops anywhere within her borders!"
 GER_rhineland_ultimatum:0 "§RThe remilitarisation may be reversed if you are confronted and back down.§!\n"
 GER_turkey_friend_desc:0 "Atatürk's Turkey is on an admirable path towards modernisation, and the country controls access to the Black Sea through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. Bringing Turkey into our sphere of influence should be our first priority!"
 GER_war_with_france_desc:0 "Now that Germany has found a satisfactory solution to the question of her eastern border, for now, it is time to turn our attention west. The loss of Alsace-Lorraine is a stain on the honour of the German people and only through a just and righteous war can we avenge this."
 GER_trade_interdiction_desc:0 "Our dockyards are committed to churning out U-boats, but we need to develop better ways of utilising these 'wolf packs'. Give the admirals everything they need to conduct their simulations and war games..."
 GER_denmark_friend_desc:0 "Gunboat diplomacy is not dead yet. Our naval expansion plans are well known to our little northern neighbour. In combination with their fear of our vastly superior armies, it should be easy enough to intimidate them into our sphere of influence."
 GER_second_ljubljana_award_desc:0 "With the Yugoslav question solved it is time to turn our attention to Greece. They too have been unjustly aggrandised by the Allies. It is time to see who our friends really are."
 GER_synthetic_rubber_desc:0 "Large-scale motorisation and aviation requires large amounts of rubber, of which we own no sources. We must improve the way we create it synthetically."
 GER_grosraumwirtschaft_desc:0 "We must prepare Germany for its destiny as a centrepiece of Europe. Our infrastructure will bind together the West with the East, and the South with the North."
 GER_oppose_hitler_desc:0 "Hitler's reign must come to an end. He means to provoke the Western powers by remilitarising the Rhineland, but doing so will give us the excuse we need to seize power with the help of loyal elements in the Wehrmacht."
 GER_rebuild_the_high_seas_fleet_desc:0 "We require a programme of massive naval build-up to rebuild our once-glorious High Seas Fleet, if we are ever to challenge the West successfully."
 GER_pride_of_the_modern_germany_desc:0 "It will take many years to match the Royal British Navy in size. So, we must outmatch it in quality. Our ships will be the most modern and powerful that have ever plied the seas!"
 GER_crossing_the_atlantic_desc:0 "With the vanquishing of all continental opposition to our rule, we must see to re-focussing our production effort to the creation of a huge navy, so that we may bring the fight to the British and the Americans. We shall not rest '...until, in God's good time, the Old World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the subjugation and humiliation of the new'"
 GER_anti_comintern_pact_unaligned:0 "Ideological Defences"
 GER_anti_soviet_pact_unaligned:1 "Formalise the Treaty"
 GER_anti_soviet_pact_unaligned_desc:1 "We should prepare for a military conflict with communism by inviting all signatories of the anti-comintern pact to agree to an additional clause calling for military support against any Soviet aggression. As we are already committed to each other in so many ways, this should be no more than a formalisation."
 GER_central_european_alliance_desc:0 "Now that we have focussed the attention of the continent on the problem, we must offer the solution: we will lead an alliance for all minor nations in Europe, which will ensure protection against this most lethal threat to our way of life."
 GER_polish_membership_desc:0 "The Poles have much to distrust all neighbours for, but they know the greatest threat emanates from the East. We shall offer them membership and protection against the threat of communism."
 GER_finnish_membership_desc:0 "Far removed from the centre of Europe, the Finns risk facing the Reds alone. But they need not to. We shall offer them membership and protection against the threat of communism."
 GER_the_mannheim_project_desc:0 "With the Heavy Water plants in Norway now under our control, we can redouble our efforts in cracking the secrets of the atom, and looking into weaponising it against the Bolsheviks."
 ITA_army_primacy_desc:0 "Industrially, Italy is still lagging behind the decadent colonial empires. We must choose whether to prioritise the army or the navy. The choice seems obvious; like the ancient Roman Empire depended on its legions, so must the new Italian Empire!"
 ITA_modernized_artillery:0 "Modernised Artillery"
 ITA_modernized_army:0 "Modernised Army"
 ITA_armored_effort:0 "Armoured Effort"
 ITA_carrier_effort_desc:0 "Modern battle fleets will be centred on aircraft carriers, not battleships. The supremacy of air power over ships was demonstrated by the Americans back in 1921!"
 ITA_yugoslavia_friend_desc:0 "Rather than antagonising Yugoslavia now, we can put off its eventual conquest until a more opportune time. Instead, we could befriend the regime and bring the country into our sphere of influence."
 ITA_german_millitary_cooperation:0 "German Military Co-operation"
 ITA_german_millitary_cooperation_desc:0 "Through tight co-operation with the powerful German military we can combine the best part of German efficiency and Italian innovation. We will have a strategic advantage over anyone who dares face us."

 SOV_finish_five_year_plan_desc:0 "The second Five Year Plan prioritises the development of heavy industry. The Soviet Union must develop quickly in order to match the Capitalist and Fascist powers of the West."
 SOV_defense_of_moscow:0 "Defence of Moscow"
 SOV_defense_of_moscow_desc:0 "The Fascists are knocking at the gates of the capital! Moscow must not be allowed to fall at any cost. Mobilise everyone, from children to old people to hastily erect what defences we can!"
 SOV_tranformation_of_nature_desc:0 "Stalin's Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature must be put into action. The environment must be shaped and moulded on a massive scale to work in the People's favour."
 SOV_collectivist_propaganda_desc:0 "In the Soviet Union, there is no room for individual glory. Our propaganda should strongly emphasise collective efforts; surpassed production goals, successful expeditions and massive construction projects."
 SOV_militarized_schools:0 "Militarised Schools"
 SOV_militarized_schools_desc:0 "Soviet children should be inculcated in military discipline and Socialist virtues like self-sacrifice and solidarity. Young minds are more easily moulded."

 SOV_ocean_going_navy_desc:0 "Although the Union encompasses a greater land area than any nation on the planet, the oceans of the world are yet to be ruled by our ships. Heavily armoured battleships will be a part of our future ocean going fleet."
 SOV_peoples_commissariat_desc:0 "The People's Commissariat of Defence Industry of the USSR will be a heavy industry ministry focussing on our military industrial projects. In the long term, the work load may require further divisions of the ministry."
 SOV_improve_stalin_line_desc:0 "Our western border must be better protected from fascist aggression. The Stalin Line should be extended and modernised."

 SOV_diversify_the_programme:0 "Diversify the Programme"
 chinese_war_focus_desc:0 "The Marco Polo Bridge incident proved that the Chinese are not interested in co-operation. With increasing tension threatening the ensuing ceasefire, war may be the only means to bring the order to the Chinese nation."
 oust_germans_focus_desc:0 "German military advisers have been present in China since at least the twenties, providing critical support to the Kuomintang. This can no longer be tolerated. We are within our rights to demand the immediate withdrawal of all German support to the Chinese. It is time for the Germans to choose sides."
 befriend_siam_focus_desc:0 "Siam has avoided European colonisation and is not used to being a subject nation. Instead of subjugating them, we should convince them to co-operate with us for it to stay that way."
 army_primancy_focus_desc:0 "Of the two main service arms, it is truly the Army which is the strong right arm of the Empire! Its ability to take and hold ground far outweighs the minor services the Navy can provide. By recognising this simple, self-evident fact and devoting more resources to the Army the possibilities are limitless."
 jap_sia_love_desc:0 "Japan has focussed its diplomatic efforts on improving relations with Siam."
 navy_primancy_focus_desc:0 "Of the two main service arms, it is truly the Navy which is the strong right arm of the Empire! Its ability to control the seas far outweighs the minor services the Army can provide.

 naval_innovations_focus_desc:0 "Now that the Navy is the recognised premier service of the Empire, it behooves us to devote more resources to the design of new ship classes."
 convoy_protection_focus_desc:0 "Although a cowardly and dishonourable tactic, it is possible that enemy nations might target the merchant ships that move supplies and resources around our Empire. We must study how best to protect these ships, should this come to pass."
 spiritual_mobilization_focus:0 "Spiritual Mobilisation"
 spiritual_mobilization_focus_desc:0 "Our entire nation, not only our soldiers, need to be spiritually prepared for war. To this end, nationalists have been brought together in the National Spiritual Mobilisation Movement to boost patriotism and support for the government."

 student_movement_focus_desc:0 "The Ministry of Education is as important a part of the Spiritual Mobilisation as any other, and having educators and students rally behind the nation will build a lasting military-oriented education system."
 industrial_effort_focus2_desc:0 "Japan is newly industrialised, and is not yet as powerful as some Western nations. We must take steps to close the gap between our capabilities."
 crypto_bomb_focus_desc:0 "The Poles have been developing a brilliant machine they call the 'Cryptologic Bomb' which can break the German Enigma cyphers. We have the resources to develop it further at our Bletchley Park facility."
 ENG_GENERAL_REARMAMENT_DESC_HISTORICAL:0 "It is starting to look like another Great War is inevitable. If it isn't Hitler it will be the Mikado, or even the Soviets... Public opinion has swung enough that we can initiate a programme of general re-armament."
 air_defense_focus:0 "Air Defence"
 bomber_command_focus_desc:0 "Like Giulio Douhet always said; 'The bomber will always get through!'. Advances in radar technology and anti-air defences notwithstanding, we should prioritise the development of better bombers."
 aircraft_production_focus_desc:0 "Aircraft production remains our highest priority. The London Aircraft Production Group (LAPG) should be created to manage and co-ordinate all available aircraft related production."
 uk_jet_focus_desc:0 "It seems almost certain that the jet engine will come to replace propeller engines on aeroplanes. The potential is enormous, and we must not allow Britain to lag behind in this crucial area of research."
 sp_landward_forts_focus_desc:0 "The current defences on Singapore Island are inadequate. We must focus our efforts on beefing up the fortifications!"
 hk_air_focus:0 "Air Defences"
 northern_expansion_focus_desc:0 "The Northern Expansion Doctrine, which has the support of the Imperial Army, recognises that the Soviet Union poses the greatest threat to Japanese ambitions. With tensions rising in Europe, a favourable moment to attack the Russian Far East is bound to present itself. We must strike quickly."
 southern_expansion_focus_desc:0 "The Southern Expansion Doctrine, favoured by the Imperial Navy, dictates that Japan must expand south into Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The rich colonies of the European powers have resources critical to Japanese industry, but this path will lead to conflict with the United States. A preemptive strike is in order."

 USA_wartime_industry_desc:0 "We have a strong industry, but not all of it is well adapted for production of war materials. Finding efficient processes to facilitate this change will be key to utilising our resources."
 USA_rubber_reserve_company_desc:0 "With the eruption of war, we have lost almost all our sources of imported rubber.\n\nWith an enormous co-ordinated effort, the rubber companies in the United States can co-operate to find better means of producing synthetic rubber, possibly even meeting the demands of the war effort."
 USA_liberty_ships_desc:0 "Mass-production of cargo ships need to accompany our industrial developments to ensure our materials and troops reach the theatres where they are needed."
 USA_war_propaganda_desc:0 "Our people don't want to send their children to die in another war, but many politicians see a need for intervention. Propaganda to demonise the enemy and call for open conflict may not only be a tool for tyrants."
 USA_war_plan_red_desc:0 "After appearing to be on the path to respecting the people, our old oppressors are now at odds with the winds of change we've accepted. The British Empire is showing its true colours. We must let them know where we stand."
 USA_pearl_harbor_gambit:0 "Pearl Harbour Gambit"
 USA_pearl_harbor_gambit_desc:0 "The naval base in Pearl Harbour is an easy target for the Japanese. By basing a fleet there, we will demonstrate our power in the Pacific. Will they dare challenge such a bold move?"

 USA_cancel_pearl_harbor_gambit_desc:0 "Stationing a fleet in Pearl Harbour endangers the lives of our sailors. We will not risk them to provoke a war with Japan."

 USA_carrier_primacy_desc:0 "Air power will be needed in battles to come, and the most practical means of extending its range is the use of aircraft carriers. We must create more advanced and specialised models."
 USA_escort_effort_desc:0 "Submarines constitute a danger to our merchant convoys. Focussing on development of new destroyer models will allow us to wage anti-submarine warfare efficiently."
 USA_reinforce_monroe_doctrine_desc:0 "Dating over a 100 years back, the Monroe Doctrine codified US intervention in the case of European attempts to colonise the Americas, but stay out of European affairs. Strengthening our role as peace-keepers on these continents will improve our influence in the region."
 USA_the_neighbors:0 "The Neighbours"
 USA_the_neighbors_desc:0 "We must first and foremost see to the safety of the countries closest to us. Rather than having the enemy cross our neighbours to get to us, they'll cross us if they cross our neighbours."

 FRA_mechanized_focus_desc:0 "Armoured vehicles play an increasingly important role in the war. While slightly less intimidating than your average tank, they give us an edge in communication, command, transport and urban warfare. "
 FRA_improved_screen_ships_desc:0 "Destroyers and Lighter Cruisers play a key role in defending our heavier Battleships or Carriers. If we lose our line of defence at sea we risk all ships and men. We must make sure our ships are built with the latest technology."
 FRA_carrier_focus_desc:0 "Naval theorists have directed our attention to our outdated Carriers. They have suggestions on how Carriers can be further utilised if development is pushed in the right direction. Real progress cannot be made without our full support."

Instead of securing ties with Britain, we should take initiative to restore and consolidiate this faction, starting with its founders in Czechoslovakia."
 FRA_invite_yugoslavia_desc:0 "Yugoslavia has enough concerns without having to worry about expansionist neighbours. Bringing them back into the Little Entente would be a great service to both them and ourselves."
 FRA_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Recent progress in ship designs have opened up new options in tactical and strategical manoeuvres. Before we take chances with these new theories we need to have them properly tested and plans solidified."
 FRA_heavy_fighter_focus_desc:0 "Our Heavy Fighters must be able to support the more vulnerable bomber aeroplanes. This requires heavier armament and longer range at the cost of some speed."

 CAN_defence_scheme_no_2_desc:0 "Defence Scheme No. 2 is our contingency plan in case of a war in the Pacific between the United States and the Empire of Japan. Ideally, we will stay neutral in the case of war, but no matter the circumstances, strong defence on our west coast will be established."

 SAF_emergency_workers_desc:0 "It is time to mobilise more of the South African population for the war effort. Women can be brought into the factories at lower cost, as well."
 SAF_cape_garrison_artillery_desc:0 "The Cape remains an important sea route for many nations, and is the gateway to the South African heartland. Expansion of the garrison's coastal defences and artillery should be at the top of our to-do list."
 SAF_reconstitute_the_cape_corps_desc:0 "Historically, we have been able to press some of our Coloured population into service to defend South Africa. This is not popular with everyone in the country, but it will free white South Africans to serve overseas."
 SAF_work_for_all_poor_desc:0 "Poor rural Afrikaners have flooded into the cities seeking work for the last few years, and we’ve done little to help them. Until now. Industrialisation and government protection of their access to work will help this population."
 SAF_outlaw_strikes_desc:0 "Work stoppages and labour disruption is unpatriotic in times of crisis. Strikes are hereby declared illegal, and the government will force people back to work."

 SAF_suppress_the_stormjaers_desc:0 "The Fascist pro-German Ossewabrandwag (OB) has a paramilitary wing modelled on similar European groups. They are disrupting government efforts to recruit troops and pursue a secure and united war policy. The Stormjaers must be broken up."
 SAF_secure_interests_in_africa_desc:0 "The Union of South Africa neighbours a number of British colonies that could be left to our administration. We should also do what we can to permanently secure our Mandate over South-West Africa."
 SAF_support_spain_desc:0 "Fascism is on the rise in Europe, and we can stop it in Spain - or at least slow its spread. Men and materiel should be sent to support the Republican cause."

 SAF_retain_experienced_pilots_desc:0 "Too often our experienced pilots move on to the RAF instead of staying with our own force. The RAF has better opportunities for advancement and combat. But we should endeavour to keep our trained pilots close to home where they can inspire and educate other South Africans."

 SAF_seaward_defence_force_desc:0 "The Seaward Defence Force has served as our navy for two decades. Its funding should be increased."
 NZL_transfer_the_new_zealand_division_desc:0 "The 2nd New Zealand Division has been mobilised for action, so we should send it where the fighting is. The NZ Division from the Great War was attached to the Mediterranean, and so will the new division."

 RAJ_indianisation_of_army_desc:0 "To properly protect India in a total war, the entire population of India should be mobilised. This will mean not just recruiting more widely from the Indian population, but allowing Indian officers to take command at some place in the chain of authority."
 RAJ_an_indian_sandhurst_desc:0 "India has been demanding a military school of its own ever since the last war, and at long last we created one in 1932. The Indian Military Academy has been turning out Indian officers for a few years now, giving us a core command group."

 RAJ_modernizing_army:0 "Modernising Army"

 USA_democratic_socialism_desc:1 "No right-thinking person can deny that socialism is the future of human civilisation.

Like our proud forefathers, we will create a new form of government that combines both."

 USA_voter_registration_act_desc:1 "Elections are the most important part of a democracy. It is utterly unreasonable to demand that there should be no checks on who can participate in them - or perhaps, the people who argue for uncontrolled elections have more sinister motivations and wish to subvert the process with voter fraud..."
